After Attack, Gainsborough Painting Returns to View

LONDON — And before you know it, everything’s right as rain.

“Mr. and Mrs. William Hallett,” an 18th-century Thomas Gainsborough oil painting that a visitor to the National Gallery in London attacked with a sharp object earlier this month, went back on display at the museum on Tuesday morning after a speedy restoration.

The museum swiftly removed the painting from its walls and briefly evacuated a wing after a visitor attacked “Mr. and Mrs. Hallett” in a seemingly random incident on March 18. In a statement, the gallery said that an attacker had used a sharp instrument to cut through layers of paint, but had not penetrated the canvas. Keith Gregory, a 63-year-old man, was arrested and charged in the attack, and appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court earlier this month. He has been released on bail and will appear again in front of a higher court in April.

In a phone interview, Larry Keith, the National Gallery’s director of conservation, said that the museum believed that the painting was attacked with a drill bit or a similar object. He said that the restoration process had included re-adhering loose paint that was still attached to the canvas; filling in areas of paint that had been scratched away, with a filling agent; painting the affected areas with new paint that had been closely matched in color and texture to the original; and, finally, covering the entire canvas with a light varnish.

Acknowledging that the particulars of the attack were unusual, Mr. Keith said that such interventions into a canvas were not rare. “Any painting of that age will almost always have had a history of interventions,” he said, calling them part of “the natural life cycle of old master paintings.”
