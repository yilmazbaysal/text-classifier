Not long ago, patent trove and semiconductor giant Qualcomm was the darling of Wall Street. Its chips dominated the smartphone market, and a gusher of royalties helped push its market cap to $138 billion by mid-2014. Then problems (reports of overheating chips, antitrust suits) hit the San Diego-based firm hard. In two years, its market cap lost more than $70 billion.

More recently, it has been in court fighting Apple and BlackBerry, the latter of which just won $815 million in arbitration. Qualcomm's shares are off 20% since January--amid a bull market on a tear.

John Buckingham, chief investment officer at AFAM Capital, thinks Qualcomm (QCOM, 54)--now trading at less than 12 times cash-adjusted earnings, with a superb balance sheet and a generous 4.3% dividend yield--is a bargain. It's a master of the courtroom, he adds, and its pending $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors will expand its footprint in higher-growth areas: automotive, Internet of Things, security and networking.
