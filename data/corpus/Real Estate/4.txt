With Help From Millennials, Denver Home Prices Continue To Rise

Few property markets are enjoying a better real estate ride than Denver. The Mile High City has seen consistent double-digit price growth the past few years, fueled in part by a surging economy and an influx of millennials.

The metro area, which has a population of about 2.7 million, received more than 100,000 out-of-state residents from 2010 through 2014, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That is the fifth-largest influx of domestic migrants in the country, surpassing cities such as Seattle and Washington, D.C.

New numbers out today suggest the city's real estate surge is far from abating.

Denver sale volume increased 44.42% compared to the month prior, according to the Denver Metro Real Estate Market Trends Report. The closed dollar volume in March in this luxury segment (single-family homes and condos priced over $1 million) was up 89% from the previous month and up 45% year over year, the realty group says.

“The spring selling season in our housing market experienced some of its own March Madness,” said Steve Danyliw, Chairman of the DMAR Market Trends Committee and Denver real estate agent. “Homebuyers and sellers will be happy by the healthy increase in activity.”

In the single-family home market, month over month, the average sold price increased 4.90% to $468,889 while the median sold price rose 2.78% to $406,000. In the condo market, the average sold price was up 7.26% to $317,402, and the median sold price was up 2.97% to $260,000.

Additionally, as in February, March experienced a surge of new listings for the residential market (single-family and condos) with an increase of 49.05% month over month and 19.35% year over year to reach 6,810 new listings.

In the residential market, active listings totaled 4,921 in March, up 26.90% from the month prior and 9.79% year over year. The number of sold listings increased by 36.01% compared to the previous month.
