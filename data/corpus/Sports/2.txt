Roger Federer takes up Bill Gates' offer to play exhibition match in Seattle

Roger Federer and billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates will pair up in a one-set exhibition match in Seattle on April 29 to support children's education in Africa.

Federer, the 18-time Grand Slam champion, and Gates will play against John Isner, who won the longest match in tennis history and an as-yet-unannounced celebrity partner.

Then Federer and Isner will square off in a best-of-three-sets singles exhibition match.

Proceeds from the Match for Africa 4 will benefit the Roger Federer Charitable Fund and Roger Federer Foundation.

Federer added to his record total of major championships by winning the Australian Open in January. He is 19-1 this season, including winning back-to-back Masters 1000 titles in Indian Wells and Miami.
