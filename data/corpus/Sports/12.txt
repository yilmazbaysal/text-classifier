Romelu Lukaku thanks Ronald Koeman for taking him 'to next level'

Romelu Lukaku says Everton manager Ronald Koeman is responsible for taking him "to the next level" as a player.

Lukaku was named Player of the Season and Players' Player at the club's annual awards night on Tuesday on the back of his 24 Premier League goals.

The Belgian striker, 23, turned down a new contract earlier this year and this week told the media to "stay out of my business" after a newspaper report linked him with Manchester United and Chelsea.

And in his acceptance speech on Tuesday Lukaku admitted he can be difficult to manage.

He said: "I'm very happy. I want to thank the manager for pushing me, even though sometimes I'm not always an easy guy. He's taken me to the next level.

"As a young guy, I just try to learn every day and give my best. Sometimes there are ups and downs but it's always with the best intentions.

"I want to help my team-mates win and I have tried my best this season."

Lukaku has two years to run on his contract, and Everton chairman Bill Kenwright told him: "I do hope we see many more goals from you, Rom."
