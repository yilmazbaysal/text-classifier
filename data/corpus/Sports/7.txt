Indian Premier League: Moises Henriques plays leading role as Hyderabad Sunrisers start with big win

DEFENDING champions Hyderabad Sunrisers got the 10th edition of the Indian Premier League rolling in style with a thumping 35-run victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore.
Yuvraj Singh (62) and Aussie all-rounder Moises Henriques (52) smashed half centuries as the home team reached an impressive total of 4-207, while Challengers lacked any real spark in the field without captain Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers, who are both injured.
Challengers were bowled out for 172 with two balls to spare and never looked like coming close after losing Chris Gayle, who top-scored with 32.
Yuvraj made Challengers pay after being dropped on 26, finishing with seven fours and three sixes. He faced only 27 deliveries before being bowled by Tymal Mills in the 19th over.

Henriques set the tone by adding 74 runs for the second-wicket stand with Shikhar Dhawan (40) after Sunrisers lost their skipper David Warner in the second over for 14.
Gayle momentarily looked to threaten Sunrisers, adding 52 runs off 34 balls for the opening-wicket stand with Mandeep Singh (24).
But Afghanistan’s young leg-spinner Rashid Khan (2-36) made a dream IPL debut by having Mandeep clean bowled in his first over, while Gayle holed out at long off in the next over, bowled by off-spinner Depak Hooda.
Veteran Ashish Nehra completed his 100 wickets in IPL and finished with 2-42, but it was Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s figures of 2-27 that never allowed Challengers to test Sunrisers.
