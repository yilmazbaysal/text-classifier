Arsene Wenger denies Arsenal are in the market for a sporting director
The Gunners need to prepare for life after the Frenchman but Wenger claimed they're not looking to hire a senior football executive

Arsene Wenger dismissed reports that Arsenal would hire a director of football, claiming that he doesn't even understand what the role entails. 

There has been increasing noise about the Gunners hiring someone to take over control of the sporting direction of the club, with The Telegraph reporting on Monday night that Arsenal were looking at Borussia Dortmund's Michael Zorc.

But when asked about those reports on Tuesday, Wenger was flippant and quick to distance himself from the claims. 

â€œWhat is that?" he asked.

"Someone who stands on the road and directs players left and right? I never understood it.

"As long as I'm manager, I'll decide what happens on the technical front," he concluded. 

With Wenger's reign coming to an end, even if that isn't this summer, the club does need to look for a raft of people who can take over the Frenchman's all-powerful role bit-by-bit. 

But if he's telling the truth and there are no plans to bring in someone to take charge of the direction of football operations, then maybe Arsenal's post-Wenger transition won't be as smooth as some think - and he could be staying a lot longer than some hope.
