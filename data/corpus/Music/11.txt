Taylor Swift apologises to Nicki Minaj for VMAs Twitter spat: 'I'm sorry, Nicki'
The singer says she ‘missed the point’ and ‘misunderstood’ the rapper’s initial argument
The Nicki Minaj debate is bigger than Taylor Swift’s ego

No sooner than Ed Sheeran jumps to her defence, Taylor Swift has admitted defeat. The pop star has tweeted her apologies to Nicki Minaj following the war of words that took place over Twitter, claiming that she “misspoke” after thinking she was being “called out”.

Minaj rapidly accepted Swift’s apology, tweeting, “That means so much Taylor, thank you.”

In response to a fan who tweeted that he was glad the pair had made up, Minaj said “Let’s move on” - a sentiment with which followers of the two-day saga may concur.

he spat, which began with Minaj’s suggestion that her Anaconda video missed out on a VMA nomination because the music industry celebrates “women with very slim bodies,” soon escalated when Swift assumed these tweets were geared towards her.

The ongoing saga – more of which you can read about here – was also picked up by Katy Perry and former CNN host Piers Morgan, both of whom shared their own, slightly sprawling opinions on the topic. Speaking to Sydney’s Daily Telegraph ON Thursday, Ed Sheeran said the Bad Blood singer had “done nothing wrong in that situation.”

She didn’t nominate herself for the awards. It’s not her fault, she just made some good videos and people think they’re good. And I think the Minaj point is a bit redundant, her point is that you have to be skinny and white to get a video of the year nomination but Beyoncé’s 7/11 is in there and that is celebrating the female figure in every form.

Earlier today, the Guardian predicted that either Beyoncé, Rihanna or Barack Obama would be the latest public figure to wade into the digital ruckus between Minaj and Swift. As yet, the President of the United States has yet to comment … But we’re keeping a close eye on his Twitter feed.
