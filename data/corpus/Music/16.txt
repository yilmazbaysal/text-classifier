Watch Blondie Perform Upbeat New Song 'Long Time' on 'Fallon'
Single appears on New Wave band's recently released 'Pollinator' LP

Blondie performed their propulsive new single "Long Time" on Tuesday's Tonight Show. Singer Debbie Harry commanded the stage with her swooning, subtle vibrato, as yellow lights flashed around her to the disco-tinged rhythm.

Harry co-wrote "Long Time" with Blood Orange's Dev Hynes. The song appears on the New Wave icons' recently issued 11th LP, Pollinator. Last month, the band released the song's frenetic video, in which Harry drives a taxi cab chaotically through New York City.

The John Congleton-produced album also features collaborations with Sia, Charli XCX, Laurie Anderson, Joan Jett, former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, the Strokes' Nick Valensi and TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek (who co-wrote lead single "Fun").

Blondie and Garbage will kick off their co-headlining Rage and Rapture Tour on July 5th in Saratoga, California.
