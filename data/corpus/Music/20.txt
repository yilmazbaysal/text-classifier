Hear Snoop Dogg's Strip Club Adventure in New Song 'Trash Bag'
Trap-infused track, featuring Atlanta rapper K Camp, will appear on Snoop's upcoming LP 'Neva Left'

Snoop Dogg navigates the strip club with a "trash bag full of cash" in his minimalist new single, "Trash Bag." Atlanta rapper K Camp sings a hazy, auto-tuned hook over whirring synth and clattering trap beat, and Snoop rattles off currency synonyms ("dollas, money, paper") and strippers' names. 

"Trash Bag" will appear on Snoop's upcoming 15th LP, Neva Left, which he announced last month. The rapper recently released weed-themed lead single "Mount Kushmore," featuring Method Man, Redman and B-Real. That track is available as an instant download with pre-orders of the 16-track LP, out May 19th.

In a statement upon announcing the album, Snoop promised that Neva Left "reflects every phase" of his career and "highlights the evolution of the Dogg." It's unclear whether the LP will include the rapper's recent single "Promise You This."

Though he'll have a new record to promote, Snoop Dogg will perform his iconic debut LP, 1993's Doggystyle, at the 2017 Hard Summer Music Festival. Snoop will headline the event's 10th anniversary edition, scheduled for August 5th and 6th, alongside Rae Sremmurd, DJ Snake, Justice, Zeds Dead, Bassnectar, Migos, Ty Dolla $ign, Skepta and Charli XCX.

In April, Snoop helped induct his late friend and collaborator Tupac Shakur into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with a poignant acceptance speech. "While many remember him now as some kind of thugged-out super hero, Tupac knew he was only human," he said. "And he represented this through his music like no one before. It's a fact he never shied away from. He wore it like a badge of honor."

In March, the rapper appeared on a remix of BadBadNotGood's "Lavender" featuring a controversial mock assassination video that earned the disdain of Donald Trump and Marco Rubio.
