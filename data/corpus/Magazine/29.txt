Gethin Jones’ new hot model girlfriend Katja Zwara dubbed 'upgrade' of presenter’s ex-fiancée Katherine Jenkins by friends
GETHIN Jones has bagged himself a hot new girlfriend, in the form of German underwear model Katja Zwara.

It has been revealed that the former Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two presenter is dating gorgeous model Katja, who has been described by his friends as "an even hotter version of his ex Katherine Jenkins", according to The Sun.
Gethin, 39, and Katherine – who recently hit back at reports about "diva behaviour" – were together for four years before they split in December 2011.
Lingerie model Katja, 28, is originally from Germany, but spends most of her time between London and Miami.
Some may recognise Katja’s face – she starred in Olly Murs' music video for Dance With Me Tonight, where she played his love interest.

Gethin has opened up about his love life in the past, revealing he wants marriage and children, but he doesn’t want to settle.
"I hope one day I am blessed to be married and have children, but you can’t force the issue," he said to The Sun

"I don’t want to be an old dad, though, I want to be able to still beat them at squash when they’re 18. 
"My sister Mererid says to me, ‘Why don’t you just find yourself a normal girl?’ – but I am just trying to find myself a girl," Gethin added.

And it seems that Gethin has indeed finally found himself a girl, after the publication revealed his relationship with model Katja.
The blonde bombshell has an array of photos on her Instagram page, showing off her stunning figure in a series of raunchy modelling snaps.
