“I’m just going to pretend I’m shooting a movie and we’re on set and I’m there for 10 months, and that’s how it’s going to be,” she told GMA, explaining that she plans to stay busy reading, learning Spanish and writing a new book.

“I have spent so much time and so much energy making other people’s children stars,” she added. “I didn’t have any children of my own — these were my kids, and I raised them like they were my kids.”

When asked if she loved her dance students, Miller broke down: “I do.”
