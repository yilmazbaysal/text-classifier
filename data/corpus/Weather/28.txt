Catastrophic flooding ensued in parts of Arkansas this week after torrential rain and levee failures.
Evacuation orders were issued on Monday for eastern Pocahontas, which included 150 homes, dozens of businesses and an assisted living facility, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Water had begun to spill over the top of the levee on Tuesday and it breached on Wednesday.
At least 50 homes were destroyed or sustained major damage due to the flooding, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
"This is the most extensive flooding in an urban area that I've ever seen as governor," Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said.

Days of heavy rain resulted in the record crests of numerous rivers across the central United States. Many parts of the Mississippi River in Missouri and Arkansas will remain above flood stage into next week.
"A general 4-8 inches of rain fell, while some locations received 10 inches of rain in part of the Central states," according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Kristina Pydynowski.
At least seven people have been killed due to the severe storms and heavy flooding in Arkansas since April 26.
According to the Associated Press, officials warned residents that wildlife like snakes, turtles and deer may be roaming around damaged property. Warnings were also issued urging people to stay out of floodwaters that may be contaminated by raw sewage and chemicals.
