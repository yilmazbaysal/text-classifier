Avalanche claims 3 lives in French Alps

Three people were killed after an avalanche struck near the French ski resort of Bonneval-sur-Arc on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press.
The avalanche struck around noon, local time, engulfing two men and one woman in deep snow.
The victims were traversing the Vallonet glacier, according to TheLocal.fr.
The area had been placed under a yellow alert for avalanches due to mild weather which can destabilize the snowpack.
Dry and mild weather with light winds is expected across the region into Wednesday morning.
