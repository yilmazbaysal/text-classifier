Virginia to New Jersey brace for damaging storms, travel disruptions Thursday

After hitting the South and Ohio Valley with severe weather on Wednesday, dangerous and disruptive storms will take aim at the mid-Atlantic coast on Thursday.

People from northeastern New Carolina to eastern Virginia, central and eastern Maryland, Delaware, southeastern Pennsylvania and central and southern New Jersey should be prepared for damaging thunderstorms, power outages, urban flooding and travel delays on Thursday.

The same storm system responsible for severe weather in parts of the central and southeastern United States at midweek will swing into the Northeast.

"The thunderstorms have the potential to bring widespread high winds to the Interstate 95 corridor and coastal areas of the mid-Atlantic," said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Bernie Rayno.

A couple of isolated tornadoes cannot be ruled out along with large hail, torrential downpours and frequent lightning strikes.

Motorists should be prepared for poor visibility and excess water on the roads.

Airline delays are likely.

Major cities at risk for violent storms include Elizabeth City, North Carolina; Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore and Salisbury, Maryland; Dover and Wilmington, Delaware; Atlantic City and Trenton, New Jersey; and Philadelphia.

While the risk of tornadoes and large hail is low from New York City to Boston, heavy rain and strong winds with urban and coastal flooding are likely. Thunder and lightning can accompany the storm in these areas.
