Why it’s finally cool to have a monobrow
Joined-up eyebrows have been maligned for many years, but reports from the professionally stylish suggest they could be on the cusp of acceptability

y mum used to come at me with tweezers. My wife tells me she is tormented by it. Friends made fun. Well, pluck you all! Because the monobrow – which I have defended for almost three decades – is cool now, according to recent trend reports.

“Unibrowed and Proud” a headline reads in the New York Times, endorsing my own, minimalist approach to grooming. I would sooner plait my lower back hair than care enough about my natural brow bridge to remove it. And apparently more young men – even cool ones – are doing the same.

“It’s my signature,” the French fashion designer Alexandre Mattiussi told the NYT, perhaps overdoing things. Other mono-bros include model Adrian Sahores in a recent Levi’s ad, a basketball player called Anthony Davis and Liam Gallagher’s model son, Lennon, whose giant face caterpillars like to get close.

For me it’s just another thing to let be. My brow used to be bushier, when I had more actual head hair. But after one of my monobrow hairs began to grow out of control, like a sunflower on Blue Peter, I agreed to include everything above the neck in my fortnightly DIY trim. One setting, one sitting – sorted.

But are vainer men than me really cultivating their monobrows? “I won’t lie, not many of my clients have them,” says Tommy Cunliffe, 28, the manager of the Shoreditch branch of Ruffians, where a “quick beard tidy” costs £15. “The ones that do tend to be slightly older gents.” Cunliffe has noticed a trend for eyebrow razoring – shaping by blade rather than tweezers or waxing – but, so far, nobody has asked for monobrow maintenance. Would Cunliffe consider joining me in the resistance, on-trend or otherwise? “I’m a sucker for a trend but my mum thinks I’m unkempt as it is with long hair and a beard, so this might tip her over the edge,” he says.
