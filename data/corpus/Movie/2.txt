Demian Bichir has been cast in New Line’s horror-thriller “The Nun,” a spinoff movie based on the demonic character in “The Conjuring 2” with British director Corin Hardy on board.

The studio began developing “The Nun” last June, shortly after “The Conjuring 2” opened. Producers are James Wan, who directed the two “Conjuring” movies and produced the sequel, and Peter Safran, who produced both movies. The current script for “The Nun” is written by Gary Dauberman and Wan.
