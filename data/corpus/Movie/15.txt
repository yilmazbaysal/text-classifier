Jurassic World 2: Jeff Goldblum Begins Filming
Jurassic World 2 writer and producer Colin Trevorrowr reveals franchise veteran Jeff Goldblum has begun filming his role for the sequel by posting a set photo on social media. Back in 2015, Universal relaunched the popular dinosaur blockbuster series with Jurassic World, which broke box office records en route to a $1.6 billion worldwide haul at the box office, making the development of a followup inevitable. The film will see Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard return in their leading parts from the first movie, but the biggest casting announcement came a couple of weeks ago when it was revealed Goldblum would reprise Dr. Ian Malcolm after being away from the series for 20 years.

Since the actor is joining the project well into production, it’s thought his part in it will be smaller than his earlier appearances, but it’s nevertheless exciting to see everyone’s favorite mathematician back in action. Just yesterday, we got word Goldblum would be joining director J.A. Bayona and crew on the set soon, and now he’s officially there to teach everyone about chaos theory again.

Trevorrow took to Twitter to share a set photo of Goldblum’s chair, which features the character’s name Ian Malcolm across the back. You can check it out below:
