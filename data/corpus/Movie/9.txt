Craig Close To Doing One More Bond?

Daniel Craig is ready to sign on to return as James Bond according to a new report at Page Six. Several sources tell the paper that franchise producer Barbara Broccoli has “just about persuaded Daniel Craig to do one more Bond movie.”

Broccoli produced Craig’s recent off-Broadway stage production of “Othello” with David Oyelowo, which won Craig several acting plaudits. Sources for the paper say:

“Daniel was very pleased with how ‘Othello’ went and the great reviews. Now Daniel’s talks with Barbara are going in the right direction. They have a script – screenwriting duo Neal Purvis and Robert Wade [who”ve penned several Bond movies] are writing and they’ll go into production as soon as Daniel is ready to commit.”

The source adds that Broccoli apparently has gone off Tom Hiddleston for the role with the actor’s public romance with Taylor Swift having “sealed his fate with Bond producers”. The report comes a year and a half after Craig famously burned bridges in the “Spectre” press tour saying he doesn’t want to return to the role.
