Handouts for diesel cars hit by 'toxin tax'

Drivers of diesel cars are to be given financial help by the Government, Theresa May has hinted, as cities across the UK prepare to introduce new taxes on the vehicles.

The Prime Minister said that drivers who were encouraged to buy diesel cars by previous governments, only to see the policy reversed, must now be “taken into account”.

Mrs May said she was “very conscious” of the fact that there was a push towards diesel under Labour more than a decade ago because of concerns over carbon emissions.

Her comments are the clearest indication yet that the Government is considering introducing a scrappage scheme to incentivise drivers to trade-in older diesel vehicles.

Alternatives could include dropping plans to tax diesels entering cities and preventing councils from making diesel drivers pay more to park.

The proposals were made as the Government prepares to introduce a so-called “toxin tax”, under which drivers of up to 10?million older diesels facing fees of up to £20 per day to drive into urban areas.

Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, on Tuesday announced the most punitive levy yet on diesel motorists as he announced plans to charge them £24 a day to drive in central London from 2019. He said: “The air in London is lethal and I will not stand by and do nothing.”

Speaking to reporters during her tour of the Middle East, Mrs May said a final decision would be taken when the Government publishes a new air quality plan, a requirement under EU laws to reduce pollution.

She said: “Decisions will be taken when we produce that plan … but I’m very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars and we need to take that into account when we’re looking at what we do in the future.”
