Ice particles shaped like lollipops fall from clouds
Tiny ‘ice-lollies’ may pull water quickly from the atmosphere

Right now, somewhere in the world, it could be raining lollies. A 2009 research flight through clouds above the British Isles gathered ice particles with an unusually sweet look. Each millimeter-sized particle consisted of a stick-shaped piece of ice with a single water droplet frozen on the end, giving it the appearance of a lollipop. Atmospheric scientist Stavros Keppas of the University of Manchester in England and colleagues report the discovery of the atmospheric confections in a paper to be published in Geophysical Research Letters.

The ice-lollies, as Keppas dubs them, start as pristine, six-sided ice crystals formed in the tops of clouds. As the crystals fall, they can fragment into needles. During the research flight, a stream of relatively warm air cut through the clouds, creating a zone of water droplets on the verge of freezing. When the falling needles passed through the warmer layer, the droplets hitched a ride on them, then froze in place. Like real lollipops in a kindergarten class, the little lollies may not last long, probably melting or deforming before hitting the ground, Keppas says.

On the way down, ice-lollies may quickly drain moisture from a cloud, the researchers propose. Spikes can form on the surface of the droplet end of the lollies as they fall. When those spikes break off, they might also gather droplets on their descent.
