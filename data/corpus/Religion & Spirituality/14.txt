UNION CITY SIKH ELDERS OUTRAGED AFTER MAN DESECRATES RELIGIOUS TEXT

UNION CITY, Calif. (KGO) -- Union City is garnering worldwide attention after a man destroyed a religious text in front of a group of Sikh elders.

The Sikh community in Union City is aghast.

"We didn't say anything to anybody, so why did he do this to us?" said Union City resident Trilok Kumar.

During their usual evening gathering at Contempo Park on Tuesday, a man walked-up with a copy of their holy text, then tore it up.

"For us it's a crime. For us it's really crime, but we cannot do anything. We cannot take law into our own hands," Kumar said.

"They're elders and they respect the culture a bit more than this generation does and their feelings were hurt," said Union City resident Avnit Kaur.

The elders called 911, while others tussled with the man as he ran back to his car.

"I tried to stop him and wait for the police," said Baldit Singh of Union City.

He got away and is described by some as possibly of Indian ethnicity.

"I could just imagine how insulted and offended they were," said Union City police Lt. Lisa Graetz. Police took a report, but say there's not much else they can do. "It might be repugnant, absolutely offensive, but he didn't break any laws in the United States. He had a first amendment right to do what he did," Graetz said.

Meanwhile, the people involve say they hope to perpetrator finds peace.

"We just pray for him please God give him good thoughts so in future he should not do that," Kumar said.
