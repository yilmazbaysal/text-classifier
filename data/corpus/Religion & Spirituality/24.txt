WIDOWED WOMEN IN INDIA CELEBRATE HOLI

Observant Hindu widows in India are often barred from participating in religious celebrations, but in the city of Vrindavan, the women get to enjoy Holi, the Hindu festival of colors.

Widowed women are expected to live their lives quietly, dressed only in white, according to ABC News. But since 2013, the aid group Sulabh International has been organizing Holi celebrations in Vrindavan, known as the City of Widows. This year, hundreds of women participated in the celebration, playing with colored powders as priests chanted religious verses.

"I am so happy. I am playing Holi after 12 years. I am happy, very happy," Aruna Samaddar told the Associated Press.
