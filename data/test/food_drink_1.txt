How to stop chopped banana going brown: M&S finds the secret

Its tendency to rapidly brown and turn to mush has long divided public opinion on whether sliced banana has a place in a classic fruit salad.
But now Marks and Spencer has developed an advanced method for keeping them firm and yellow, with the help of a secret housewives' trick.
The discovery, which comes after years of testing, has prompted it to add bananas to its classic fruit salads for the first time.
As home cooks who make fruit salads know only too well, using banana can prove tricky as it quickly discolours when its skin is removed.
The old housewives' method to avoid this is to drizzle the slices with lemon juice, which slows the aging process as it is acidic.
M&S has enhanced this technique by spraying banana slices with a mix of citric acid and amino acid as soon as it is peeled.
The coating preserves the banana for longer without affecting the taste or the nutritional content of the banana.
Bananas brown more rapidly than other fruit as they contain high amounts of a chemical called ethylene. When the fruit is peeled and cut ethylene is released and the acids in the fruit begin to break down.
This causes it go soft and meansbananas' yellow pigments decay into characteristic brown spots in a process called enzymatic browning.
M&S also tested various varieties of banana to find the slowest ageing and calculate the peak time during the ripening process to prepare the fruit.
It found Cavendish bananas are the slowest ageing and chops them when they re slightly under ripe, giving them time to develop flavour once they are sprayed and packaged.
Until now retailers have avoided using banana in fruit salads for fear of them going brown.
But now two of M&S's salads from its Spirit of Summer range contain them - its "banana and berry pot" and "Kiwi, Strawberry, Banana and Mango" contain the fruit and are flying off the shelves, it claimed.
Rose Wilkinson, fruit technologist at M&S, said, “We know our customers love banana in fruit salad – it is a delicious addition and adds a lovely soft texture to compliment the other fruits.
But as everyone who has made fruit salads at home knows – the banana turns black once it is sliced.
"We’ve spent years trying to overcome this so that we can include it in our prepared fruit salads and were delighted when we discovered a clever trick using fruit acid – just like you would at home with lemon juice! Our customers love the new salads and they are flying off the shelves.”
