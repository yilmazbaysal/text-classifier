An Organ Master Who’s Part Musician, Part Mechanic

The huge pipe organ in St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral, at Prince and Mott Streets in NoLIta, is in startlingly original condition, though a bit worse for 150 years of wear.

Jared Lamenzo is so accustomed to showing off this monstrous marvel of an instrument that he can discuss it even while using all four of his limbs to bang out a Bach fugue or Buxtehude toccata.

See his hands play two separate keyboards and his feet dance a bass line on the foot pedals, with thin leather shoes on his feet, for better feel.

“I call them my dancing shoes,” he said, making remarks that were casual and music that was not.

Something akin to an angel’s choir swirled out of the organ, reverberating from the choir loft, under the church’s vaulting arches, through the nave and past the glorious stained-glass windows.

“It’s a quirk of fate that this still even exists,” Mr. Lamenzo said of the musical artifact built in the 1860s by Henry Erben, a temperamental but brilliant organ maker whose factory was nearby.

It has been played at tens of thousands of Masses, weddings and funerals, and is still a workhorse. Each week, Mr. Lamenzo can play more than a dozen services and rehearsals on it, and often slips into the empty church at night to practice.

As the church’s director of music, Mr. Lamenzo has been playing and maintaining the organ for 15 years and has built the music program around it, coupling it with ensembles and choirs he runs in English, Latin and Spanish.

Mr. Lamenzo, who lives with his wife, Ilona Parkansky, and their two small children, Misha and Katya, grew up in Broad Brook, Conn., in a 300-year-old farmhouse and acquired a taste for mechanical tinkering while helping his father fix old cars. He also studied the piano and, as his friends were listening to Bon Jovi, he fell in love with the recordings of the concert organist E. Power Biggs.

Mr. Lamenzo attended Harvard to study mechanical engineering, but also to have access to the venerable Flentrop pipe organ in Adolphus Busch Hall.

After college, he worked in Manhattan as a banker while playing keyboards in a salsa band led by a New York City police officer who held rehearsals at his grandmother’s East Harlem apartment.

Mr. Lamenzo also filled in as an organist at churches around New York City and was hired to play a wedding at Old St. Pat’s. The organ had been neglected, and some of its stops — levers that activate different sets of pipes with varying timbres and similarities to different instruments — were broken.

He tried the working ones, first the Pyramid Diapason, then the Choir Organ, then the Flute Harmonique, a high, sweet tone that shot straight to the altar.

“I remember thinking, ‘There’s not a stop on this that doesn’t sound beautiful,’” he recalled before hitting the low C from the foot pedal, which brought a seismic rumble from one of the towering pipes lining the organ’s Gothic facade.

“It’s a strange thing to say about a 20-ton instrument, but we found each other,” he said.

The organ is the size of a small studio apartment and twice as tall, with nearly 2,500 pipes, ranging from 24-foot-high giants to some no bigger than a pencil.

Slipping inside the organ’s housing, through narrow ladders and platforms, feels like entering a cuckoo clock.

“These are the lungs,” he said, bending down to compress the organ’s bellows, made of wood and leather, that serve as a reservoir for the air that creates sound in the pipes.

Instead of its original hand-cranked air pump, the organ uses an electric blower. Otherwise, the instrument is fully manual, with no electricity but for the few carpenter’s lights Mr. Lamenzo has hung to find his way and the humidifiers he deploys in dry weather.

He keeps an oil can and set of tools handy for day-to-day maintenance; sometimes repairs must be done in the middle of a performance.

On Easter Sunday last month, a nut fell off one of the rods leading to a pipe for a low F, a crucial note for a coming toccata. Mr. Lamenzo grabbed a wrench and crawled under the console like an auto mechanic. He repaired the part just in time to play the toccata in his dust-covered suit.

During another Easter, Mr. Lamenzo saw the organ keys moving on their own and realized that intruders had climbed inside the organ and were jiggling the mechanisms. It turned out to be two French tourists doing some exploring. He ordered them out.

Now, on the verge of the organ’s 150th anniversary, Mr. Lamenzo is seeking to raise over $1 million to restore and preserve it and improve its playing condition, even at the risk of losing its seasoned sound.

“I know I’m being an overly concerned father, but it terrifies me, to be honest,” he said, and then chose some Mendelssohn to play, with all four limbs.

“Some days, I come in here and I can’t believe I’m playing this,” he said. “It’s still vital and living and doing its job, and will be for the next 150 years.”
