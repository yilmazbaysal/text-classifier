Katy Perry searches for 'hot' pictures of herself online

Katy Perry combats her insecurities by searching for "hot" images of herself online.

The Chained to the Rhythm singer had posted two unflattering pictures of herself on Instagram recently, and told her fans on Wednesday (05Apr17) that she felt the need to balance her feed out with an attractive picture.

Accordingly, she searched the words "Katy Perry hot" on Google and shared one of the image results by taking a screengrab and posting it on her page.

"Was feeling insecure about my last two posts so," she captioned a picture from a sexy photoshoot in which she is seen holding a lemon while stood in a kitchen. The airbrushed Katy is wearing unbuttoned denim shorts, a revealing denim bralet and a rosary necklace, which rests between her cleavage.

The sexy snap comes just days after she posted a throwback picture which showed a younger version of herself wearing a sports bra and shorts while sat in front of a computer in an office. She has messy hair and no make-up in the snap, which she jokingly told fans was her next album cover as part of an April Fools' Day (01Apr17) joke.

"I'm proud to announce the cover for my 4th album!" she teased. "Happy April Fools! Been plotting in the same type of sports bra from my IM (instant messenger) and laminated calendar since 99'.... (sic). It's all about the long game..."

On Wednesday, she also posted a series of screengrabs from her FaceTime session with an A&R representative from her record label, during which Katy received a facial massage that contorted her face into unflattering positions.

"When ur rollin calls with ur A&R but trying to massage the stress out ya jaw at the same time cause everything is coming to a head!" she wrote.

The 32-year-old has not yet announced when her fourth album will be released.
