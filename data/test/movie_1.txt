An updated version of the synopsis for Marvel’s Black Panther teases the threat of world war after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Since Boseman successfully debuted the Wakandan-leader and new Black Panther in last year’s Civil War, fans have clamored for any new information as to what his solo film will be about. Given that it will not be an origin story like most first character standalone films, its narrative offers something new to the moviegoing audience especially in this day and age of superhero-centered movies.

Black Panther is a little less than nine months away from hitting the cinemas and a new synopsis for the standalone has been released providing additional insight as to where fans will find Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa and his people when the film picks up.

The synopsis courtesy of Licensing Global reads:

“After the events of Marvel’s Captain America: Civil War, King T’Challa returns home to the reclusive, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to serve as his country’s new leader. However, T’Challa soon finds that he is challenged for the throne from factions within his own country. When two foes conspire to destroy Wakanda, the hero known as Black Panther must team up with C.I.A. agent Everett K. Ross and members of the Dora Milaje, Wakanadan special forces, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world war.”

There was a previously released synopsis for Black Panther earlier this year. But even if that gave fans a sense of what is next for the King of Wakanda, no specifics were included. However, this new one paints a clearer picture of the stakes that the film’s narrative will tackle. There is confirmation that not just one, but “factions” of foes will be coming out for the Wakandan throne – although it can be presumed that by the end, the main villain will still be Michael B. Jordan’s Erik Killmonger. It is also interesting how Martin Freeman’s Everett K. Ross will be teaming up with T’Challa after the events of Captain America: Civil War.

A very notable element in Black Panther is that Marvel Studios made a conscious effort to bring in very talented actors of color from various generations to fill in its casting sheet. From Angela Bassett as T’Challa’s mother Ramona to Forest Whitaker as Wakandan statesman Zuri director Ryan Coogler made sure to capture the vibe of what it is like to be in an African nation – even a fictional one.

Needless to say, it seems like T’Challa will be pulled in all directions as he tries to navigate his way through being a superhero and the leader of Wakanda. Politics will play a big role in the movie and fans will likely wonder how Marvel has effectively woven in the usual beats of a comic book film. Since T’Challa was forced into his current situation with the sudden death of his father, T’Chaka (John Kani), his inexperience in both fields is expected to be a huge character development arc for him.
