2017 French Open: July-like heat to build for opening round

Above-normal warmth will mark the start of French Open qualifying on Monday. Above-average warmth will remain through the end of qualifying on Friday.
The two-week tournament will host some of the world's greatest tennis players in Paris, starting on Sunday.
Late May is usually a comfortable time in the French capital, with highs in the upper 60s F (around 20 C). However, it will feel more like late July during qualifying and the first round of play.
"Afternoon temperatures in Paris will reach 80 F (around 27 C) on Monday, which is well above normal" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Tyler Roys.

Despite some clouds mixing in, the sunshine throughout the day will be strong, and can cause a sunburn for spectators and players alike. Those spending time outside should wear protective clothing and sunblock, as well as drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.
While an area of high pressure slowly moves across northern France through the middle of the week, largely dry and warm conditions will remain.
Roys expects temperature highs to remain in the middle and upper 70s (24-26 C) through Thursday before even warmer air builds into the region.

In addition to the summerlike temperatures, Roys adds that the chance of rain will remain low this week and sunshine will be abundant.
Philippe-Chatrier Court, the primary venue at Roland Garros, remains the only stadium out of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments that does not have a roof to help avoid lengthy rain delays. However, with dry weather expected this week, rain delays should not be an issue. Plans are underway so that the venue will have a roof by 2020.
Intense heat will build over France from the weekend into early next week with with daily high temperatures over 27 C (80 F).
Along with the heat, the chance for showers and thunderstorms will increase during the first round of play from Sunday into Tuesday.
