Italian Open: Elina Svitolina beats Simona Halep for fourth title of 2017

Ukraine's Elina Svitolina came from a set down to beat Romania's Simona Halep 4-6 7-5 6-1 and win the Italian Open, her fourth title of the year.

Halep, 25, who won the Madrid Open last week, rolled her ankle when leading 5-2 in the first set, but managed to take it 6-4.

The world number four had her ankle strapped in the second set, which Svitolina took 7-5.

The third set was a one-side affair as Svitolina won 6-1 in 30 minutes.

Svitolina, who also called for a trainer in the second set, adds her Rome title to victories in Istanbul, Dubai and Taipei City.

The 22-year-old is currently ranked 11th in the world, but will return to the top 10 when the rankings are updated on Monday.

World number two Novak Djokovic plays Alexander Zverev in the men's final later on Sunday.

The French Open, the second Grand Slam of the year, begins on 28 May.
