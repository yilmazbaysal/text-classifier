Rain to frequently disrupt outdoor plans in northeastern US this week

After a week dominated by summerlike and record heat, the northeastern United States will face rounds of rain slowing travel and disrupting outdoor plans this week.
The upcoming bouts of wet weather will prevent heat from re-surging into the Northeast, but will plague sporting events or those ready to spend most days outdoors.
Instead of wearing shorts and short-sleeved shirts, residents will be grabbing umbrellas on a frequent basis.
The new week will start on a rainy note along the Eastern Seaboard as the storm responsible for the recent severe weather and flooding in the central U.S. slowly advances eastward.

Drenching showers and thunderstorms will focus from the central Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast on Sunday before shifting to the I-95 corridor Sunday night into Monday.
Some of the rain will pour down heavily, raising the risk of isolated flash flooding in urban and poor drainage areas.
However, there will be more incidents of slower travel on roadways, flight delays and disruptions to outdoor plans.
Thunderstorms threaten to delay or postpone Sunday afternoonâ€™s conclusion of the baseball series between the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park.
