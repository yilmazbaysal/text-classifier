MY COUNTRY TIS OF THY PEOPLE, YOU’RE DYING

Through May 26. Radiator Gallery, 10-61 Jackson Avenue, Queens; 347-677-3418, radiatorarts.com.

This show of work by Native American artists organized by Erin Joyce Projects at a collaborative art space in Long Island City, Queens, has been in the works for a couple of years but is only getting more timely. This exhibition includes provocative and handsome photography (by Tom Jones), sculpture (Cannupa Hanska Luger) and film (Steven J. Yazzie), as well as the Winter Count Collective’s memorable short protest video.

The standout is Nicholas Galanin’s take on the cult of white martyrdom that underlies and abets institutionalized American brutality. A suit of ceramic body armor at once threatening and fragile, the sculpture hangs on the wall in pieces, as if reconstructed empirically from a series of bruising discoveries. The suit’s design, by Mr. Galanin, is a cross between ordinary riot gear and the uniform of a “Star Wars” Stormtrooper — the ceramic is white with an oily, iridescent glaze, and a police baton hangs nearby. Its title, “God Complex,” is overkill, since hanging the outfit in cruciform makes the point more effectively. But the insight is right on: A grandiose sense of victimhood, inflamed by epic fantasies and impervious to rational disproof, is one of the best tools there is for victimizing others.

Through June 3. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, Manhattan; 212-645-1701, jackshainman.com.

What’s in a home? At the very least, a portrait of its occupants, and a fertile memory bank — of rooms, light, objects and relationships — for frequent visitors. This much is demonstrated by the captivating, often large paintings in “Homemaker,” Becky Suss’s excellent Manhattan debut at the Jack Shainman Gallery.

These views of comfortable middle-class interiors — most of them from her grandparents’ now-demolished Long Island home — are eerily still and shelter-magazine neat. The furniture, rugs, books, art and artifacts are placed just so, yet they set a lot in play. Representing a range of world cultures, they appear to be tokens from the travels of well-educated people: They conjure a complex mix of delight, taste, openness and an admiring, seemingly benign colonialism.

Stylistically, these scenes are superhybrids. They have the detail and sweetness of folk paintings; a scale that’s sometimes Abstract Expressionist; the sharp-focus of photography and the geometry and spatial tricks of hard-edge abstraction.

In “August,” with its facing armchairs and end tables beneath a framed rubbing from Angkor Wat, the vividly grained parquet floor recedes at one angle through a door and at another through a broad archway. In “Blue Apartment,” a nearly flat blue-patterned rectangle sort of resolves itself into a covered bed. These rooms and their contents must have helped Ms. Suss become an artist. We sense their hold on her and are alerted anew to the ones that haunt us.

Richard Tinkler is an artist with a day job. There’s nothing unusual about this, except that he has become known — he was mentioned in a ARTnews article about moonlighting artists — for working behind the front desk at one of Matthew Marks’s galleries in Chelsea. Mr. Tinkler’s exhibition “Paintings and Drawings,” at 56 Henry Street, offers a chance to become better acquainted with his artwork.

This Lower East Side gallery is essentially a storefront microspace, and Mr. Tinkler has used it wisely, wrapping seven of his abstract geometric paintings around three walls, with the canvases almost touching. Each painting was made in one day, using a wet-on-wet oil technique. Subtle brush strokes and hatch marks create patterns that resemble the warp and weft of textiles, and some of the paintings are reminiscent of work by Mark Tobey or Bradley Walker Tomlin — or, in their coloring, Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay-Terk. The installation feels contemporary, however: You read the work collectively, as a system or an archive rather than as discrete, individual works.

In the gallery’s window bay are portfolios that also function as archives, holding 46 of Mr. Tinkler’s vibrant drawings. These are like the miniature grids of Paul Klee or the intricate notebook drawings of Lori Ellison. It is rumored that he has, at times, worked on the drawings while on the job at Matthew Marks. Having written art reviews covertly while working in an office long ago, I can relate — though I hope I don’t get him in trouble for mentioning that here.

Robert Bordo’s paintings are visual haiku. Starting with a banal enough image — something automotive like a roadside billboard — he abstracts it nearly beyond recognition, ornaments it with colors and frills, and, most important, excises it from its ordinary context. The earliest piece in “Back Flip,” a show of old and new work, is an untitled canvas from 1988 that shows a blotchy blue grid with what look like a couple of yellow stains at the sides. . Strictly speaking it’s a close-up of a map, but without any landmarks to anchor them, those colors and forms can expand with gentle, open-ended ambiguity.

In “Creek” (2008), he summons a blizzard onto a patchwork black surface with six white dots. And the most recent pieces, three canvases from 2017, include two, “Snowed” and “Marked Man,” that render a creek as a narrow tree trunk, and a third, “Slings and Arrows,” that simplifies this idea even further, into a kind of punning blackboard diagram. But my favorite is “Wacko,” from 2012, in which a rearview mirror becomes a metaphor for consciousness and the passage of time. An ellipse surrounded by a whirl of concentric green and brown impasto shows a vertical road stopping short at the horizon; above the ellipse, it continues on unchecked.
