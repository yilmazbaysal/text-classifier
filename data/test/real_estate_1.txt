Homes Sold Faster Than Ever in April, Survey Shows

U.S. home prices rose 6.2 percent to a median sale price of $280,000 in April, according to national realtor Redfin. Home sales inched up 1.2 percent over last year, constrained by a shortage in the supply of homes. The number of homes for sale fell 13.3 percent, the steepest decline in four years, marking 19 straight months of annual declines.
The typical home went under contract in 40 days, 10 days faster than a year earlier, making April the fastest month on record since Redfin began tracking the market in 2010. One in five homes (22.2%) that sold in April went under contract within two weeks of their debut. One in four (24.7%) homes sold above their list price, which is the highest percentage Redfin has recorded.
“When it comes to the housing market breaking records, I’m beginning to sound like a broken record,” said Nela Richardson, Redfin chief economist. “The market tends to accelerate through June so I wouldn’t be surprised if new records for speed and competition are reached in May and June given what we are seeing now. The only record this market can’t break is sales. You need more inventory for that!”
Denver, CO was the fastest market, with nearly half of all homes going under contract in just 6 days, down from 11 days a year earlier. Seattle, WA was the next fastest market with 7 median days on market, followed by Portland, OR and Tacoma, WA at 10 days.
The most competitive market in April was San Jose, CA where 75.4% of homes sold above list price, followed by 69.5% in San Francisco, CA, 69.4% in Oakland, CA, 62.1% in Seattle, WA, and 52.4% in Tacoma, WA. In sharp contrast, 0.0% of homes in Kansas City, MO sold above the list price.
Milwaukee, WI had the nation’s highest price growth, up 18.2% since last year to $208,000. Greenville, SC had the second highest price growth at 17.6% year-over-year, followed by Seattle, WA (17.4%), Deltona, FL (14.8%), and Tampa, FL (13.8%).
2 metros saw price declines in April: Baton Rouge, LA (-1.2%), and Greensboro, NC (-1%).
18 out of 90 metros saw sales surge by double digits from last year. Poughkeepsie, NY led the nation in year-over-year sales growth, up 36%, followed by Baltimore, MD, up 31%. Camden, NJ rounded out the top three with sales up 28% from a year ago.
