After 30 years, this supernova is still sharing secrets

Ian Shelton was alone at a telescope in the remote Atacama Desert of Chile. He had spent three hours taking a picture of the Large Magellanic Cloud. This wispy galaxy orbits our own, the Milky Way. Suddenly, Shelton was plunged into darkness. High winds had taken hold of the rolltop door in the observatory’s roof, slamming it shut.
“This was maybe telling me I should just call it a night,” recalls Shelton. It was February 23, 1987. And that evening, Shelton was the telescope operator at Las Campanas Observatory.
He grabbed an 8-by-10 inch glass plate from the telescope’s camera. It had caught an image of the night sky. But it was only a negative. So Shelton headed off to the darkroom. (Back then, photographs had to be developed by hand from negatives instead of appearing instantly on a screen.) As a quick quality check, the astronomer compared the just-developed picture with one he had taken the night before.
And one star caught his eye. It hadn’t been there the previous night. “This is too good to be true,” he thought. But to be sure, he stepped outside and looked up. And there it was — a faint point of light that wasn’t supposed to be there.
He walked down the road to another telescope. There, he asked astronomers what they could say about an object that bright appearing in the Large Magellanic Cloud, just outside the Milky Way.
“Supernova!” was their response. Shelton ran outside with the others to double-check with their own eyes. In the group was Oscar Duhalde. He saw the same thing earlier that evening.
They were witnessing the explosion of a star. This supernova was the closest seen in nearly four centuries. And it was bright enough to view without a telescope.
“People thought they’d never see this in their lifetime,” recalls George Sonneborn. He is an astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. (NASA is short for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.)
With roughly 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe, there’s almost always a star exploding somewhere. But a supernova close enough to be seen with the unaided eye is rare. In the Milky Way, astronomers estimate, a supernova goes off every 30 to 50 years. But until that time, the most recent one seen was in 1604. At a distance of about 166,000 light-years, the new one was the closest since the time of Galileo. Astronomers would dub it SN (for supernova) 1987A (indicating it was the first of that year).
Supernovas are “important agents of change in the universe,” notes Adam Burrows. He is an astrophysicist at Princeton University in New Jersey. Most heavyweight stars end their lives as supernovas.
These explosive events also may trigger the birth of new ones. Such cataclysms can change the fate of entire galaxies by stirring up the gas needed to build more stars. Most chemical elements heavier than iron, perhaps even all of them, are forged in the chaos of such explosions. Lighter elements are created over a star’s lifetime and then spewed into space to seed a new generation of stars and planets — and life. These include “the calcium in your bones, the oxygen you breathe, the iron in your hemoglobin,” Burrows explains.
Thirty years after its discovery, supernova 1987A remains a celebrity. It was the first supernova for which the original star could be identified. And it spewed the first neutrinos — a kind of particle smaller than an atom — detected from beyond the solar system. Those subatomic particles confirmed decades-old theories about what happens in the heart of an exploding star.
Today, the supernova’s story continues to be written. New observatories draw out more details as shock waves from the explosion keep plowing through the gas between stars.
SN 1987A has dimmed “by a factor of 10 million,” notes Robert Kirshner. “But we can still study it.” An astrophysicist, Kirshner works at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. In fact, he notes, today “We can study it better and over a wider range of light than we could in 1987.”
