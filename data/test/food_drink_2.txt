11 Best Bourbons (Plus 5 Awesome Ryes) For Kentucky Derby Season 2017

As I've mentioned before, I absolutely love the Kentucky Derby. There's nothing like checking out the odds, picking a horse with a peculiar name, and cheering it on for the most exciting two minutes in sports. (This year, I'm looking at Irish War Cry.)
In addition to that, you're practically “required” to consume vast quantities of mint juleps and bourbons. (And if you’re so inclined, ryes.) But if you’re planning to wager on the Run for the Roses, do so before you imbibe.
But back to bourbon. I'm not alone when it comes to my enthusiasm.
DISCUS (the Distilled Spirits Council of the United State) states that in 2016, bourbon and Tennessee whiskey generated $3.1 billion in revenue for distillers. That means roughly 22 million nine-liter cases of the stuff were sold in the United States. The category has been growing for some time now: in 2015, it eclipsed all other spirits.
So to make the most out of my Derby Day experience, I reached out to Julianna Arquilla, The Betty's head bartender. The Betty is a neighborhood restaurant located in Chicago’s Fulton Market District and it’s got a healthy bourbon and rye list. And her own personal picks are as interesting as they are diverse. “I picked these bourbons and ryes because they range from everyday whiskey to the special and rare,” Arquilla says. “This list includes a whiskey for everyone and every moment.”

Four Roses Yellow
“This bourbon is near and dear to me: It’s the first bourbon I shared with my father and one of his favorites as well. To me it’s a classic and will never go out of style.”

High West Yippee Ki-Yay
“I love the flavor and depth that this rye has. Being aged in Syrah and vermouth barrels brings out dark caramel, orange, cinnamon, and currant notes on the palate.”

Henry McKenna Single Barrel
“This bourbon is big and bold—perfect for everyday drinking. I just can’t say enough about how much I love this whiskey, not only for taste but value as well.”

Rittenhouse Rye
“This rye is my go-to rye for Manhattans. It has a great bold flavor that can stand up to vermouth and not get lost. It’s also a great value, so it’s perfect to have at home and play around with cocktails.”

WhistlePig Old World Cask Finish Rye 12 Year
“This whiskey is really neat because it blends three different and unique finishes together—Madeira, sauternes, and port. And I happen to love all of those flavors. It is aged in each of those casks then turns into a really special whiskey with flavors of dark chocolate, caramel, and ripe berries. It’s the perfect dessert.”

Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style Bourbon
“One of the bourbons from the Whiskey Row Series that Old Forester has put out. This one is my favorite, because I love how this bourbon is sweet but still comes in a little hot.”

Michter’s US*1 American Whiskey
“This whiskey is one of my new favorites, because it has just right amount of sweetness, vanilla, rich caramel, and dried fruit. Also, unlike bourbon and rye, which must be aged in new oak barrels, Mitcher’s American Whiskey is aged in used bourbon barrels, which gives it unique flavor.”

Sazerac 18 Year Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey
“Part of Buffalo Trace’s Antique Collection, this is rye worthy of its cost. This straight rye has a subtle spice and dry sweetness that lingers on your tongue, making it incredibly enjoyable.”

George T. Stagg Kentucky Straight Bourbon
“This whiskey is big and bold. On the nose I get toffee sweetness with hints of vanilla and molasses. There’s a hint of bitter coffee that finishes on the palate. While I love Stagg Jr., this expression just has a bit more kick to it that I love in bourbon. And with a few drops of water, it really opens up and mellows out.”

Old Weller Antique Original 107
“This wheated bourbon drinks soft at first, but then all of the flavor and heat hits you, making it feel more like a barrel proof bourbon. It is one of my favorite bourbons to use in a mint julep.”

Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Barrel Proof Bourbon
“For having a proof with a punch of 125-plus proof, it’s still a very approachable bourbon that can be sipped neat. It surprised me on how soft and delicate it is on the nose but still is beautifully complex.”

Woodford Reserve Double Oaked
“This bourbon is perfect for sipping or for making a classic cocktail a little different. I love how rich this bourbon is, thanks to the twice barreling. It gives the bourbon a creamy caramel, toasted brioche taste with a hint of tobacco.”

Old Grand-Dad 100-Proof
“An industry staple. Perfect for any party. I have shared this bottle with many coworkers and friends. It is always great to have on hand, and fun to do a blind tasting with because it will always surprise your guests.”

Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon 12 Year
“I love how full and beautiful this bourbon is. It’s a great value, really appreciable, and is great one to always have around on your shelf.”

Buffalo Trace
“This is one of my favorite go-to bourbons for an old fashioned. It has just the right amount of backbone. Paired with the sugar, bitters and orange and lemon expression, this bourbon sings.”

Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye 13 Year
“This 13 year rye is really something special. The powerful sweetness is balanced by the spice of the rye. And the wood aging makes it really unique and full-bodied.”
