Mets’ Bullpen Holds On to Beat the Angels

It was a night of milestones for the Mets — Terry Collins’s 1,013th game as their manager, the most in team history, and Jose Reyes’ 2,000th hit — but until the very last pitch, a fastball from Addison Reed that pinch-hitter Danny Espinosa swung through with the bases loaded to secure a 7-5 victory, there was no guarantee of a reason to celebrate.
Yes, the Mets received another acceptable starting performance from Zack Wheeler, who has been elevated from a luxury in a loaded rotation to a necessity in one decimated by injuries and ineffectiveness.
And yes, they had built up what looked like an insurmountable four-run lead against a punchless Los Angeles Angels lineup, which was missing Albert Pujols and had not scored a run since Wednesday.
And yes, Reyes was finally showing signs of busting out of his two-months-long funk, with three hits, including the milestone hit in the first inning and a two-run single in the eighth. The latter looked like window dressing in what appeared destined to be an effortless Mets victory, their second in a row after a seven-game losing streak.
But here they were in the ninth inning facing yet another bullpen meltdown, with three runs in, two out, the bases loaded and Reed, the makeshift closer, struggling to get one more strike past Espinosa.
“Before the game, I told someone I felt like I was 50 again,” Collins said afterward. “But after that, I’m back to being 67.”
Reyes, who sported the plastic-jewel-encrusted crown and blue-and-orange boxing robe that is worn by the hero of a Mets victory, exuded relief more than exultation after another nerve-racking victory had finally been tucked away.
“Hey, a win is a win,” he said. “No matter how ugly it looks out there.”
It was long and slow and a little boring in spots — the game took 3 hours 37 minutes to play — but not really ugly until that ninth inning, which began with the ball in Neil Ramirez’s hand and ended with it in the glove of catcher Rene Rivera an excruciating 43 pitches, three walks, three hits and three runs later.
The most anxious moment came when Mike Trout stepped to the plate with the bases loaded, none out and the Mets clinging to a 7-4 lead.
“My first thought was, I’d almost rather walk this guy than give him a pitch to hit,” Collins said. “Remember how Buck Showalter walked Barry Bonds with the bases loaded? I had pretty much the same feeling. Did I consider it? Oh, absolutely.”
Instead, Collins covered his eyes and allowed Reed to pitch to Trout. Collins was rewarded when Reed kept Trout in the ballpark, his fly ball to right fielder Jay Bruce scoring just one run rather than the potential four.
The anxious moments were not quite through — after getting the second out, Reed walked Andrelton Simmons to reload the bases before striking out Espinosa — and the questions about how long the Mets can walk this tightrope of adequate starting pitching followed by hair-raising relief pitching were hardly resolved.
But they were replaced by the improbability of the achievements of Collins and Reyes, neither of whom could have been considered a lock to reach them. Collins was a washout as manager of the Houston Astros and the Anaheim Angels, and he seems to start every season with the Mets on lists of managers most likely to be fired.
Reyes, of course, was a face of the franchise along with David Wright in 2004, and at the time it seemed that if he were to reach 2,000 hits, it would be as a Met. But after a career of moves — from Miami to Toronto to Colorado — and ups and downs, culminating in a domestic violence arrest that led to a 51-game suspension last season, it was doubtful he would play major league baseball again, let alone in New York.
“Last year, at this point, I was sitting on my couch and didn’t even know if I would continue to play in the major leagues,” he said. “I remember thinking, ‘What is going to be next for me?”’
Reyes’s three-hit night was his second of the past three games, and it nudged his batting average above .200 for the first time this season. Batting second behind Michael Conforto — who was on base four times and scored three runs — seems to have helped Reyes at the plate, and as Collins pointed out, so has his return to playing shortstop with Asdrubal Cabrera on the disabled list.
“When you look at guys like Jose, guys that have a legitimate track record, you always think they’re going to come out of it,” Collins said. “You just continue to run them out there, and it’s paying off.”
Reyes said: “I know a lot of people doubt me, and that motivates me. I’m still only 33 years old, and I still believe in my talent.”
