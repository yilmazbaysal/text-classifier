Harry Styles Fights the Spotlight on His Debut Solo Album

The first rule about being in a successful boy band is understanding that one day you will no longer be in a successful boy band. The baggage of that life will be removed, but so will the perks. If, underneath all that, you have a beating heart, a robust sense of self and a modicum of taste, the potential for growth is great. Your future may take on a shape of its own, rather than just the shape of the shadow of the past.

So in a way, a boy band star’s first solo album is merely a salvo in the fight to not be defined by yesterday. If it’s successful, it affords a specific sort of anonymity, the one that comes with no longer being yoked at the hip to a huge phenomenon.

Even though One Direction was the boy band that began to dismantle the norms of the form, it was still the biggest one of the last decade. And so the self-titled solo debut of Harry Styles, one of its two breakout stars — the other being Zayn Malik — is both an answer to his past and a template for his future. Mr. Malik, who makes mildly sludgy pop-R&B, got to market first, and also seems at least tangentially interested in the market. Mr. Styles would like to be excluded from that narrative.

So goes this sometimes great, sometimes foggy album, which is almost bold in its resistance to contemporary pop music aesthetics. Instead, it’s steeped in the singer-songwriter music of the late 1960s and 1970s, and in moments, in the flamboyant harder rock of the late 1970s and 1980s.

One Direction had some use for these ideas — it was always the most rock-minded of boy bands, which are usually more preoccupied with, you know, rhythm (these boys didn’t dance). But Mr. Styles’s deep dive into this territory is both uncharted and effective. He’s a strong singer (within a narrow range) and has a general air of exhaustion in his tone. Whatever exuberance One Direction once demanded of him has been squelched.

Mr. Styles is at his best when he’s at his least involved. “Sweet Creature,” one of this album’s highlights, is full of gentle Café Wha? guitar and straightforwardly earnest singing. Similarly, the album closer, “From the Dining Table” has the barest guitar, though here Mr. Styles’s vocals are subjected to a hollowing effect that makes him sound more disconsolate than anywhere else on the album.

What’s got him so down? Why, the wages of post-fame, of course. This is a song about a fuzzy love connection that begins with another broken connection, from his old self. “Woke up alone in this hotel room,” he laments, then continues, “Played with myself, where were you?/Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon/I’ve never felt less cool.”

Exhausted and spent: This is some life. First post-boy-band albums are also where symbols of maturity are dangled: Mr. Styles would like you to know he has been debauched, or something like it. “I’m just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth,” he sings on “Only Angel,” which has the faintest whiff of the Sunset Strip. That’s followed by “Kiwi,” which is parodically sleazy and unconvincing. On the blues-rock number “Carolina,” he sounds thirsty and amused, wondering “How could you ever turn her down?” with McCartneyish cheek.

The most persuasively sinful moments are on the opener, “Meet Me in the Hallway,” another soft musical moment that doesn’t bother to find the hope that’s on the other side of decay. “Give me some morphine, is there any more to do?” he sings, before swirling into shouted despair: “Just let me know, I’ll be on the floor, on the floor!”

These narcotic singer-songwriter gestures are presumably an excavation of Mr. Styles’s own personal taste, but it also certainly helps that, by design, his music can’t be directly compared to anything his bandmates have done or will do. But his peers aren’t his heroes either — wearing psychedelic suits and playing piano with melancholic pomp does not a Ziggy Stardust make (see, the distended single “Sign of the Times”).

At worst, Mr. Styles runs the risk of being unfashionable. There are few paths less attractive in 2017 than that of guitar troubadour working in the pop mainstream. But Mr. Styles doesn’t appear troubled by that challenge, nor is he at the vanguard of a classic rock revival. Instead, he is a conscientious objector — to the shadow cast by his old life, to the comparisons to his old peers, to the gleam of modern pop, to all of it.
