South-central US braces for flooding, severe storms early this week

Rounds of flooding downpours and severe thunderstorms will take aim at the south-central United States early this week, endangering residents and property.
The unsettled weather from this weekend from the central Gulf Coast to central Texas will worsen into Monday as the number of severe weather and flooding reports may increase.
While any thunderstorm rumbling to end the weekend can turn severe, a more concentrated area of violent thunderstorms will ignite across south-central Texas Sunday afternoon into Sunday night.
This includes from Austin and San Antonio to Del Rio.
The strongest thunderstorms will be capable of producing damaging winds, hail, frequent lightning and flooding downpours. An isolated tornado cannot be ruled out.
Flooding downpours will become the predominate risk as the thunderstorms and soaking rain spread eastward along I-10 corridor in Texas and Louisiana overnight Sunday into Monday.
However, there can still be isolated damaging wind gusts and a tornado.
“Even though Houston has had a relatively dry month with only around 0.50 of an inch so far in May [prior to Sunday], things will turn around early this week,” AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Baker said.
