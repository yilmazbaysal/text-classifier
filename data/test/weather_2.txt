Record-breaking heat poised to bake the West Coast

Temperatures will soar across the western United States early this week, surpassing even late-summer heat levels.
The recent period of dry weather in many Western cities will make it easier for heat to build in the region.
“A large area of high pressure will transport some of the warmest air since last summer across the West Coast early this week,” AccuWeather Meteorologist Brett Rathbun said. “Records will be challenged from Washington to California.”
Highs in the upper 70s F in and around Seattle on Sunday will be more reminiscent of late July or early August.
“Seattle could have its first day above 80 F since last August early this week,” Rathbun said.
Farther south, hotter weather will challenge higher heat records.
“Portland, Oregon, could break 90 F for the first time since August,” Rathbun said.
Monday’s temperature to beat is 100 F in Sacramento; the forecast high of 98 will come close.
Coastal areas can expect marine influences to limit rising temperatures.
While the century mark is not uncommon in the Central Valley of California in the summertime, these conditions will be the hottest of the season thus far.
Residents must take precautions to enjoy the heat and sunshine responsibly.
The sun angle is currently similar to that of late July, making for a very high UV index and increased threat of sunburns.
Reapplying sunscreen regularly, wearing protective clothing and limiting time spent in direct sunlight can greatly decrease the chances of a bad sunburn.
Heat exhaustion is also a dangerous side-effect of the upcoming weather pattern.
“Anyone doing strenuous outdoor activities across central California should take frequent breaks and drink plenty of water,” Rathbun said.
The heat is expected to break after only a few days, providing relief to the baking West Coast.
“A storm will begin to cool the West down by the middle of the week, especially across the Pacific Northwest,” he said.
