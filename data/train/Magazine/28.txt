Coronation Street's Helen Flanagan suffers MAJOR makeup mishap as she flaunts her jaw-dropping figure in flesh flashing white ensemble
CORONATION Street star Helen Flanagan is known for always looking sensational on and off the cobbles.

Helen, who only recently returned to reprise her role as Rosie Webster on Corrie, has been spotted spending time away from the famous street – in the midlands.
The 26-year-old was spotted looking more glamorous than ever as she headed out in Birmingham on Tuesday.
Wearing a gorgeous bright white suit and smart baby blue top, Helen dazzled as she showed off her fantastic physique, smiling widely as she strutted her stuff down the pavement.
Flaunting her long, tanned pins – which were  accentuated with an exceedingly tiny skirt – the blonde bombshell looked divine on her outing, with golden make-up emphasising her striking features.

But it seems the Corrie stunner had a bit of a make-up mishap – as with the flash of the camera lights, the jaw-dropping actress looked heavily highlighted as she headed to get a bite to eat.
Despite the faux-pas, the beautiful I’m A Celeb sensation still managed to look absolutely divine on her outing.

Helen gave birth to her first child, daughter Matilda, with Scott Sinclair on 29 June 2015, and returned to her Corrie role earlier this year. 
She made her long-awaited return to Coronation Street just months ago – and one person who was very happy with the decision was her co-star and on-screen sister, Brooke Vincent.

The 24 year old admitted to OK! Magazine: "I've just had Helen back, and us two being back together will open different doors for story lines as well." 
And speaking about having her co-star being heavily in the public eye, the actress admitted: "Helen kind of did the learning for the both of us. I just watched how she handled the situations she was in.
