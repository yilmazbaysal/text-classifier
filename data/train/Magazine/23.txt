Following the release of Prism back in 2013, singer Katy Perry is revealing new details surrounding her new album and what fans can expect from the pop star's new sound.

Though the new album has yet to be titled, Perry gave fans insight into the genre of music that the project plans to produce. "It’s really quite brave" says Perry, "Sonically, it’s fun and dance-y and dark and light. It’s all of these things. It definitely is a change." Following her first single, "Chained to the Rhythm," the pop star is no stranger to experimenting with different sounds as the singer's latest single, "Bon Appetit," features hip-hop trio Migos.

Finally, after years of speculation surrounding her rumoured feud with fellow pop star Taylor Swift, Perry had this to say, "Honestly, when women come together and they decide to unite, this world is going to be a better place. Period end of story." Though her message of female unity render true, the singer was sure to add warning to those who "come" for her. "You can’t mistake kindness for weakness and don’t come for me. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that’s not to any one person and don’t quote me that it is, because it’s not." She continued, "Everything has a reaction or a consequence so don’t forget about that, okay, honey. We got to keep it real, honey. This record is not about anyone else! This record is about me being seen and heard so that I can see and hear everyone else!"

Notably, Katy Perry will also appear on Calvin Harris's forthcoming album Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1. You might remember Harris as the former flame of Taylor Swift, and a one-time flake on Katy Perry. Seems the two have made up.
