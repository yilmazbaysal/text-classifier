“Everyone always wants to make me myself. Because not only am I a model but I guess have a name too, so they get confused, they don’t know how to use me.”

V105 cover star Kendall Jenner sat down with famed photographer Mario Testino for his podcast On the Sofa and opened up about working together and the creative drawbacks of modeling, specifically mentioning how she believes that the fashion world does not experiment with her enough.

“I love being transformed,” she explains. “Everyone always wants to make me myself. Because not only am I a model but I guess have a name too, so they get confused, they don’t know how to use me.” Specifically, she says she wants to go in a more sexual direction sometimes, shouting out V for letting her do so. “I don’t get to be hot very often,” she tells Testino. “I love going like, sexual, because I don’t get to do it.” The photographer agrees, adding, “It’s so weird because you have the body. I think that maybe people are intimidated to take you there. Maybe you’ve done a lot of American Vogue and it’s not about that and it’s more about clothes.”

Not one to leave out her friends, Kendall opens up about working with her supermodel peers, including Gigi and Bella Hadid. “Gigi and I just started getting close when we started modeling,” she remarks. “But Bella and I were actually really good friends since high school, and hung out everyday in high school before either of us started working. It’s just funny because a lot of people don’t know that Bella and I have been friends for five or six years.” The collaborators also reminisce about their first shoot together for Allure and how Testino was so worried that she wouldn’t like the curly hair. Turns out that’s exactly the kind of different look she likes to try while modeling. Listen to the full podcast here.
