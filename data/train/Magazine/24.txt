NICKI MINAJ PROMISES TO PAY COLLEGE DEBT OF FANS

Evidently, the hip-hop superstar was feeling generous this weekend when she agreed via Twitter to foot the bill for several fans' outstanding college loans, textbook costs, and artistic equipment.
It started when a fan tweeted at Minaj asking if she'd help pay for their college tuition. Minaj assured the 21-year-old that if he could offer proof of straight A's, she'd pay the sumâ€”a proposal she extended to her global fan base. Twitter just about imploded, as the reigning rap queen's feed was flooded with requests.
In under an hour, the artist had promised over $20,000 worth of loans to twelve different students, NBC reports. Other than occasionally asking for proof of enrollment, Minaj did not question her fans' needs or demand a sob story. TMZ has verified that at least two of the students who tweeted have received payments from Minaj.
