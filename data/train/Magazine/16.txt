"Having kids is wonderful, and life changing, and rarely what you're prepared for," the Buffy the Vampire Slayer alum, 40, captioned a black-and-white throwback photo of herself and Charlotte, now 7. "I love my children more than anything in the world. But like a lot of women, I too struggled with postpartum depression after my first baby was born.
