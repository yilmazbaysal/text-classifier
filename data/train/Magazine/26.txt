Katie Price films romantic display with husband Kieran Hayler as he kisses her on cheek after they reunite following reports Loose Women star ‘got close to’ another man on boozy Miami break despite vowing to go sober for the year
KATIE Price returned home to husband Kieran Hayler on Tuesday, after she was spotted getting close to another man in Florida.

However, Katie’s reunion with her husband appeared to be a happy one, despite the Loose Women star being seen seemingly "worse for wear" on a night out in Miami this week.
Katie had been Stateside to film her new reality show My Crazy Life when she was spotted with a mystery man.
But when she returned home, she was greeted by her husband with open arms.
Katie shared a video on Instagram of Kieran kissing her on the cheek, after she tricked him into taking a selfie.

After posing for a picture, but filming a video instead, Katie smiled as Kieran laughed, before saying: "You’re such a d***", and pecking her on the cheek.
The couple’s romantic display comes after Katie was seen "getting close" to a fellow club-goer while partying in Miami.

The star was out with her make-up artist pal Gary Cockerill when she was seen getting close to a dark-haired man – news that might have shocked Katie's third husband Kieran. 
An onlooker told The Daily Star: "Katie seemed wasted. She was there with friends, but at one point she was slumped over the bar.

"She was visibly very woozy but seemed to perk up a bit when she got chatting to this guy.
"They were very touchy feely, and at one point he leant up behind her and put his arms around her waist. She seemed quite animated with him."
