'More Life' Means More Drake Atop Billboard Artist 100 Chart

Fueled by his latest album, the superstar reigns for a 25th total week, extending his mark for the most among males.

Drake remains the top musical act in the U.S., holding at No. 1 on the Billboard Artist 100 chart (dated April 15).

The Artist 100 (which launched in July 2014) measures artist activity across key metrics of music consumption, blending album and track sales, radio airplay, streaming and social media fan interaction to provide a weekly multi-dimensional ranking of artist popularity.

Drake rules the Artist 100 for a second consecutive and a 25th total week, extending his mark for the most time at No. 1 among male artists; among all acts, only Taylor Swift has tallied more weeks at the summit: 31.

A week ago, Drake vaulted from No. 7 to No. 1 on the Artist 100 (marking his first week on top since Nov. 19, 2016) with a 603 percent blast in overall activity as his album More Life stormed in atop the Billboard 200 with 505,000 equivalent album units (the year's biggest weekly total) in the week ending March 23, according to Nielsen Music. This week, he keeps atop the Artist 100 despite a 50 percent drop in overall chart points. The decline mirrors the 55 percent plunge for More Life in its second week, although the set stays atop the Billboard 200 with 226,000 units in the week ending March 30.

Last week, album sales marked Drake's greatest share (50 percent) of Artist 100 chart points, followed by streaming (34 percent). On the April 15-dated Artist 100, streaming takes the lead (50 percent), followed by album sales (27 percent).

Rounding out the latest Artist 100's top five, Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars hold at Nos. 2 and 3, respectively; The Chainsmokers climb 6-4; and Metallica rebounds 14-5 as its album Hardwiredâ€¦To Self-Destruct is the Greatest Gainer on the Billboard 200, where it surges 19-5 (50,000, up 110 percent). The set continues to profit mostly from a concert ticket/album bundle sale redemption promotion with the act's stadium tour that went on sale Feb. 17.

Ed Sheeran's 'Shape of You' Tops Hot 100 for 10th Week

The song is now part of a mere 3 percent of leaders all-time to reign for double-digit weeks. Plus, The Chainsmokers tie the longest streak of weeks in the top 10 among non-solo acts.

Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You" leads the Billboard Hot 100 chart (dated April 15) for a 10th week, joining an exclusive club of hits that have ruled for double-digit weeks in the chart's 58-year history.

Meanwhile, The Chainsmokers match the longest streak of consecutive weeks in the Hot 100's top 10 among duos or groups, having ranked in the tier for 48 straight weeks.

As we do every Monday, let's run down the top 10 of the Hot 100, which blends sales, airplay and streaming data. All charts will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, April 4.

As it continues to command the Hot 100, Sheeran's "Shape," released on Atlantic Records, becomes just the 34th No. 1 to lead for at least 10 weeks dating to the chart's Aug. 4, 1958, inception; a mere 3 percent (34 of 1,061) of the Hot 100's all-time No. 1s have reached double-digit total weeks on top.

Among Atlantic singles specifically, "Shape" is the fifth to top the Hot 100 for 10 weeks or more. The one to beat with the longest stay: Brandy and Monica's 13-week No. 1 "The Boy Is Mine" in 1998.

Overall, "Shape" is the first title to top the Hot 100 for double-digit frames since The Chainsmokers' "Closer," featuring Halsey, which led for 12 weeks in 2016. Earlier in 2016, Drake's 10-week No. 1 "One Dance," featuring WizKid and Kyla, became the last such smash among solo males prior to Sheeran's.

As it crowns the Hot 100 for a 10th week, "Shape" does the same on the Digital Song Sales chart (85,000 downloads sold, down 12 percent, in the week ending March 30, according to Nielsen Music), becoming just the 10th hit to total double-digit weeks atop the tally. It's the first since "Closer," which logged a record-tying 13 weeks at No. 1.

"Shape" adds an eighth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (173 million in audience, up 1 percent, in the week ending April 2) and a fourth frame atop Streaming Songs (46.2 million U.S. streams, essentially even week-over-week, in the week ending March 30).

Impressively, "Shape" has topped the Hot 100 and its three main component charts (Digital Song Sales, Radio Songs and Streaming Songs) simultaneously for four weeks running. Since Streaming Songs launched in early 2013 (as the most-recently-added of the three lists), only two songs had previously led the trio of charts (as well as the Hot 100) for at least four straight weeks at the same time: "Closer" (six weeks, 2016) and Mark Ronson's "Uptown Funk!," featuring Bruno Mars (six, 2015).

Back to this week, with more Mars: his "That's What I Like" holds at its No. 2 high on the Hot 100. It pushes 3-2 on Radio Songs (119 million, up 15 percent), earning the Hot 100's top Airplay Gainer award for the fifth time in the last six weeks. The track keeps at No. 2 on Digital Song Sales (79,000, down 1 percent) and rises 6-3 on Streaming Songs (30.1 million, up 9 percent). "Like" notches a seventh week at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot R&B Songs chart and a third atop Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.

And, more Chainsmokers: the twosome of Alex Pall and Drew Taggart zooms 7-3 on the Hot 100 with "Something Just Like This," its collab with Coldplay. The song passes its prior No. 5 high to tie for The Chainsmokers' second-highest-charting hit: before their 12-week No. 1 "Closer," "Don't Let Me Down," featuring Daya, reached No. 3 in July 2016. Coldplay has charted higher only with "Viva La Vida," its sole No. 1 in 2008.

"Something" stays at No. 4 on Digital Song Sales (59,000, down 1 percent) and surges 18-12 on Radio Songs (59 million, up 20 percent) and 25-15 on Streaming Songs (18.3 million, up 3 percent). It leads the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart for a fourth week.

Thanks to "Something," as well as the duo's No. 6-peaking "Paris," which rebounds 10-9, The Chainsmokers have now spent 48 consecutive weeks in the Hot 100's top 10, dating to May 21, 2016 (and encompassing four top 10s), tying Ace of Base's record streak among non-solo acts. Here's an update among all artists:

Most consecutive weeks in the Hot 100's top 10
69 weeks, Katy Perry, 2010-11
51 weeks, Drake, 2015-16
48 weeks, The Chainsmokers, 2016-17
48 weeks, Ace of Base, 1993-94
46 weeks, Rihanna, 2010-1

Rounding out the Hot 100's top five, The Weeknd's "I Feel It Coming," featuring Daft Punk, hits a new peak, rising 5-4, led by its identical 5-4 lift on Radio Songs (98 million, up 1 percent). Plus, KYLE returns to the top 10 at a new high, charging 12-5 with his debut hit "iSpy," featuring Lil Yachty; it had reached a prior No. 10 best rank two weeks ago. With its latest climb, Lil Yachty matches his highest Hot 100 placement, as he'd first ascended to a No. 5 high as featured on D.R.A.M.'s "Broccoli" in November. Streaming leads the way for "iSpy," which jumps 8-6 on Streaming Songs (26.9 million, up 14 percent). The track also continues to add airplay, as it rises 44-36 on Radio Songs (34 million, up 20 percent).

"iSpy" additionally takes over at No. 1 on the Hot Rap Songs chart, becoming KYLE's first leader and Lil Yachty's second; "Broccoli" ruled the list for nine weeks.
 
Migos' "Bad and Boujee," featuring Lil Uzi Vert, drops 4-6 on the Hot 100, following three nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1; Zayn and Taylor Swift's "I Don't Wanna Live Forever (Fifty Shades Darker)" tumbles 3-7, after hitting No. 2; and Kodak Black's first Hot 100 top 10, "Tunnel Vision," dips to No. 8 from its No. 6 Hot 100 high.
 
Closing out the Hot 100's top 10 (below The Chainsmokers' "Paris" at No. 9, as noted above), Drake's "Passionfruit" slips to No. 10 after debuting at No. 8 a week ago. Driven heavily by streaming, the track keeps at No. 4 on Streaming Songs (26.2 million, down 10 percent), as well as No. 1, for a second total week, on the audio subscription services-based On-Demand Streaming Songs chart (24.4 million on-demand U.S. streams, down 16 percent). The track stays at No. 22 on Digital Song Sales (25,000, down 7 percent) and gains by 118 percent to 13 million in airplay audience. As previously reported, parent album More Life spends a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, having earned 226,000 equivalent album units (down 55 percent) in the week ending March 30.
