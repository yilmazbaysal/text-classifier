Hear Feist's Stormy Collaboration With Jarvis Cocker, 'Century'

Feist released a stormy new song, "Century," from her upcoming fifth LP, Pleasure. The track opens with the singer crooning over ragged guitars and pounding percussion, but the vibe shifts midway through, with former Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker reciting an eerie poem about the length of a century.

"How long is that?" Cocker intones. "3,155,973,600 seconds, 876,000,000 hours or 36,500 days – almost as long as one of those endless dark nights of the soul, whose noise never ends." 

"Century" premiered Wednesday on Zane Lowe's World Record radio show on Beats 1. Feist also announced a globe-spanning summer tour behind Pleasure. The trek launches April 27th in Toronto and runs through August 19th in Winterthur, Switzerland. The new LP, out April 28th, is Feist's first album in six years, following 2011's Metals.

The Canadian singer co-produced the 11-track set with two previous collaborators, Mocky and Renaud Letang. Last month, she released the album's guitar-driven title track.

"Mocky is the drummer on that track, and it's only the two of us on that track, and we were saying it's just a couple of human bodies just moving, bashing things," she told Lowe of the primal arrangement. "The whole record is pretty much Mocky and I in that face-to-face of – it’s pretty stark instrumentally. It's the two of us and at the end of the day our motto is kind of 'how to hit what and how hard' – that’s the motto."

In addition to Pleasure, Feist will appear on Broken Social Scene's upcoming fifth LP, which the indie-rock collective is expected to release this summer.
