Maurizio Pollini to Play Chopin at Carnegie Hall

At 75, the pianist Maurizio Pollini may no longer be the guarantor of crystalline precision he was for much of his storied career.
In recent years, bouts of illness have cut holes in his concertizing schedule, and reviewers of his solo recitals almost always mention the odd fudged run or transition. But the adoring fans who continue to seek him out, and who will almost certainly muster at Carnegie Hall on Sunday, May 21, don’t just attend to pay tribute to a memory.
Mr. Pollini continues to be a master of unmannered elegance and cleareyed storytelling, especially so in the music of Chopin, to which this recital made up principally of nocturnes and ballades is dedicated.
The program culminates in Chopin’s Piano Sonata No. 3 in B minor, a 30-minute technical tour de force that will call on all of Mr. Pollini’s dexterity, but that also requires the kind of depth and insight that many pianists bring most forcefully to their playing late in life. (carnegiehall.org)
