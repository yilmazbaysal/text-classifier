New Lana Del Rey album will include Stevie Nicks collaboration

Legendary Fleetwood Mac singer will appear on Lust for Life, which also features appearances from the Weeknd and Sean Lennon
Fleetwood Mac legend Stevie Nicks will appear on Lana Del Rey’s forthcoming fifth album, Lust for Life.
It will be one of several collaborations on the album. Del Rey has already premiered the title track, which features the Weeknd, while the album will also include a Sean Lennon collaboration, Tomorrow Never Came. The lead single, Love, was released in February.
Lust for Life may be a pointed title for the singer, whose major label debut was titled Born to Die. Del Rey once caused controversy by telling the Guardian “I wish I was dead already”, for which she received criticism from the likes of Frances Bean Cobain.
No release date for the album has been confirmed. A spokesperson for Lana Del Rey had no further information at this time.
