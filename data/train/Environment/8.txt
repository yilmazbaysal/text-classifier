Lendlease to build first ultra-green homes in central London

Development? company Lendlease is to pioneer ultra-energy-efficient homes in central London, monitoring the residents over several years to see how new technology could change the housing market.

The 15 Futurehome buildings at Lendlease’s huge regeneration project at Elephant and Castle, which are the first to be built in zone one of the capital, will be sold this spring.

The developer wants to monitor residents with a view to creating more green buildings in the future.

Dan Labbad, chief executive of Lendlease’s international operations, said: “We’ll see how these go and then look at what we can learn from it.”

The move comes as the Government continues to urge housebuilders to adopt more modern types of construction to beat skills shortages and build homes faster. In a housing White Paper published last month, it reiterated its support for developers using off-site construction techniques which generally result in better energy efficiency and lower waste.

Lendlease’s homes are built to Passivhaus standard, a low-energy measure developed in Germany, and include triple-glazed windows, and a water recycling system so that water from the shower can be used to flush toilets.

Mr Labbad added that the firm was trying to stay ahead of technological advances in building, knowing that its schemes could be sold to buyers who might live in a very different environment.

“Some of our schemes people who are going to live in them aren’t even born yet, because they’re 20 or 30 year projects,” he said.

Lendlease is aiming for its Elephant & Castle scheme to be the first carbon positive urban regeneration scheme in the UK, meaning it produces more energy from its own plants than it uses.
