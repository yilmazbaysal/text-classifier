CHRISTIANS MARK GOOD FRIDAY WITH SERVICES AROUND THE WORLD

Christians are marking Good Friday with processions and services all around the world.

Pilgrims carried crosses in the Holy Land. They believe their journey re-traced the steps Jesus Christ took through Jerusalem before he was crucified.

Greek clergymen led a Good Friday service atop a hill in Athens; they then removed an icon of Jesus from a cross and placed the icon inside a cave.

In New York City, hundreds of people joined a Good Friday procession across the Brooklyn Bridge. They passed Ground Zero on their way to a historic church in Lower Manhattan.
