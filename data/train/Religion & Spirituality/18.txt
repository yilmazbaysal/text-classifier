HUNDREDS PACK SAN JOSE CHURCH FOR PLAY ON GOOD FRIDAY

Today is Good Friday, an emotional and deeply spiritual day for Christians around the world.

That was definitely the case for hundreds who packed a San Jose church to watch a play depicting Jesus Christ's final days on Earth.

People said they felt compelled to attend Friday's performance. "It enlightens me, it comforts me. With all that's going on in the world today, it just puts me at peace," Pablo Rivera said.

There will be another performance Friday at 8 p.m. at the Cathedral of Faith in San Jose.
