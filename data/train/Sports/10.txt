NBA: James fuels Cavaliers rout of Magic

LOS ANGELES: LeBron James's 18 points in the Cleveland Cavaliers's 122-102 victory over the Orlando Magic on Tuesday marked his 788th straight game in which he scored in double digits, moving him to second on the NBA's all-time list.
James's 18 were part of a triple-double that also included 11 rebounds and 11 assists -- his 12th triple-double of the season and the 54th of his career in regular-season games.
The last time James failed to score in double digits was on January 5, 2007, when he put up eight points against the Milwaukee Bucks.
He moved past Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the second-longest such streak in league history. Michael Jordan heads the list with 866 consecutive games of double-digit scoring.
No doubt more important to James, the victory pulled the reigning NBA champion Cavaliers level with the Boston Celtics atop the Eastern Conference ahead of Wednesday's showdown between the two.
Kevin Love led the Cavaliers with 28 points and 11 rebounds.
Kyrie Irving added 24 points and J.R. Smith chipped in 19.
Smith and Love drained five three-pointers apiece. Kyle Korver, back in action after a four-game absence with a left-foot injury, added three three-pointers and scored 11 points off the bench.
With 18 three-pointers total, the Cavaliers became the third team in NBA history to make 1,000 three-pointers in a season. Their tally for this campaign now stands at 1,004.
