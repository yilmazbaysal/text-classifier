14 More “Transformers” Films Could Be Made

Talking at a preview event for the upcoming “Transformers: The Last Knight” in London this week, filmmaker Michael Bay revealed that there are approximately fourteen “Transformers” feature stories currently outlined.

The number is likely the result of the “Transformers” writing room initiative several years ago which laid the groundwork for the future of the franchise over the next decade or so – including direct sequels, spin-offs and more. ‘Last Knight’, though the fifth in the series and Bay’s last, marks the first film created from this initiative.

Bay appeared in a pre-recorded segment before the footage and said that the new stories had come out of the development process. One of them is likely to be the Travis Knight-directed “Bumblebee” spin-off, another an animated prequel about Cybertron.

At the same time Paramount Pictures has released a new featurette for the film in which Bay discusses the process of shooting native IMAX 3D. “Transformers: The Last Knight” will hit cinemas on June 23rd 2017.
