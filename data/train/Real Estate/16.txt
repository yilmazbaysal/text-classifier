These Three Hombuilders Are Benefiting From Resurgence Of Connerton

All over the United States there were many planned communities that stalled and became dormant, thanks to the “Great Credit Crunch” of 2008. The housing development I have been following since 2009 is Connerton, located in the center of Pasco County Florida, 25 miles north of the heart of the City of Tampa. Here's why this is important for the housing market:

The city of Connerton came to a halt in December 2009 and stayed dormant until mid-2013. Today, thanks to publicly-traded homebuilders Lennar (LEN), M/I Homes (MHO) and Taylor Morrison (TMHC), and local builder “Homes by West Bay,” Connerton has returned to the vibrancy envisioned by the city planners back in 2000.

Each year in April, the Tampa Bay Builders Association sponsors what’s called the Parade of Homes, and this year Connerton was designated the Showcase Community for 2017. This year's Tampa Bay Parade of Homes featured all five model homes of Connerton. This was quite an accomplishment, for a huge housing development that became comatose between mid-2009 and mid-2013.

Before expanding on the importance of Connerton, let’s look at the weekly charts for the publicly-traded homebuilders and how to buy and sell these stocks.

Lennar (LEN) was trading at $50.12 mid-day on May 2, up 16.7% year-to-date and in bull market territory, 26.3% above its post-election low of $39.68 set on Nov. 9.

The weekly chart for Lennar will be downgraded to negative given a close this week below its five-week modified moving average of $50.46. The 200-week simple moving average of $43.96 is the “reversion to the mean.” The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to end this week at 74.07, trending below the overbought threshold of 80.00.

Buy Lennar on weakness to my monthly and quarterly value levels of $44.95 and $43.79, respectively. My semiannual pivot is $48.95. Sell strength to my annual risky level of $59.99.

M/I Homes (MHO) traded at $27.35 mid-day on May 2, up 8.6% year-to-date and in bull market territory, 34.1% above its post-election low of $20.40 set on Nov. 9. The stock set its post-election high of $28.42 on April 27 on a positive reaction to earnings released after the closing bell on April 26.

The weekly chart for M/I Homes is positive with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $25.55. The 200-week simple moving average of $22.31 is the “reversion to the mean.” The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to end this week at 54.02 rising from 55.45 on April 28.

Buy M/I Home on weakness to my quarterly and semiannual value levels of $21.80 and $20.48, respectively. My monthly pivot is $26.01. Sell strength to my annual risky level of $30.03.

Taylor Morrison (TMHC) traded at $22.89 mid-day on May 2, up 18.8% year-to-date and in bull market territory, 31.6% above its post-election low of $17.39 set on Nov. 9. The stock set its post-election high of $24.60 on May 1 on a positive reaction to earnings released before the opening bell on April 27.

he weekly chart for Taylor Morrison is positive but overbought with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $21.80. The 200-week simple moving average of $19.07 is the “reversion to the mean.” The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to end this week at 82.97, trending above the overbought threshold of 80.00.

Buy Taylor Morrison on weakness to my quarterly value level of $15.48. I show annual and monthly pivots of $21.30 and $22.53, respectively. Sell strength to my semiannual risky level of $39.53.

Now back to the City of Connerton...

Homebuilding represents about 16% of GDP and this building of new homes in Connerton is creating local jobs. The National Association of Home Builders estimates that building 100 single-family homes creates nearly 300 jobs, $28 million in wages and business incomes, and generates about $11 million in federal, state and local taxes.

April was New Homes Month, which benefited the builders in Connerton.

Long before the housing bubble popped in the middle of 2006, there were many planned communities that were sprouting up all over the country. Connerton was a former working cattle range that covered 8,000 acres conveniently located with access to Tampa and its international airport via I-75 to the east and the Suncoast Expressway, a toll road to the west. There are three entries to this reviving community right off U.S. 41, the north-south route that used to be the main highway between Chicago, Illinois and Miami, Florida.

The Connerton dream began in 2000, and the early plans changed during development in 2003, when the State of Florida bought 3,000 acres to preserve some of the beauty of the county that is the southern-most county of the three counties known as Florida’s Nature Coast.

Back on Dec. 24, 2009 I wrote, "Florida Community Serves as Benchmark for Main Street Recovery.” In this analysis, Connerton would have been a self-contained city with 8,500 homes, businesses, a hospital, its own school system, and recreational facilities.

The first of five planned villages, called The Arbors, was nearly sold out, and in the second village called The Gardens, new homes were being sold until the community welcome center shuttered on Dec. 8, 2009.

Developers planned to sell 700 to 800 homes each year, but the construction stopped, and total sales of new homes totaled only around 200.

The community did have benefits of several completed structures, including a community hospital, an $8 million activity center known as Club Connerton, and one of five planned shopping centers became operational. This gave the surrounding communities of about 2,700 homes access to a Publix supermarket, and several small retail stores that changed several times since 2009. A SunTrust Banks (STI) and a Walgreen Drug Store would soon open.

When I wrote my original story in 2009, I indicated that Connerton would be my indication of the status of the housing market given the huge scope of this planned community.

The community reopened in mid-2013, with homebuilders Ryland, M/I Homes, Taylor Morrison and locally-owned “Homes by West Bay” beginning their communities. Back in July 2014 I wrote, "Homebuilders Such as Ryland Make Bet on Once-Dormant Florida City.” After a year of being reopened things moved rather slowly as builders began to sell homes at a pace of three to five per month.

Optimism returned in April when the “Tampa Bay Builders Association Parade of Homes” featured the five fully-furnished model homes of the in Connerton. Ryland was no longer one of the homebuilders and Lennar had its best month with sales that totaled more than 20 units.

The bottom line: Connerton as gone from dormant in 2009, to the leader of the parade in 2017. One builder estimated that the community now has 700 homes with the average pace of building and selling at about 10 homes per builder. There’s a lot of acreage to go, and the community goal remains a lofty 6,000 homes.
