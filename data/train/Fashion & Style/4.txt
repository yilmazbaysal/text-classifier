Hermès Reveals "Exceptional Year"

IN the words of Hermès CEO Axel Dumas, the stars aligned in 2016 for the storied French fashion house, as its profit margins hit an all-time high.

Year-on-year sales at the company increased 7.5 per cent, taking the company over the $5 billion mark for the first time, and has been attributed - among other things - to booming business in the UK following Brexit.

"Once again a strong year from Hermès," Dumas told the Financial Times. "It's keeping its galloping moment... 2016 was an exceptional year because the stars were aligned for us: currency, growth and the collections did well."

The brand's creative director, Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski, has sustained praise for her collections since she came on board at the brand in 2014. As a part of this week's results, Dumas revealed that "the only constraint was the capacity of production".

Hermès is not the only luxury house enjoying buoyed results at the moment. Kering revealed last month that both Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci "posted exceptional comparable growth - 25.5 per cent and 12.7 per cent, respectively".
