If you think socks and sandals are heinous, sit down and prepare yourself, because this is the summer you'll see tights paired with open-toe sandals. And we're not talking about the fishnet tights Kylie and Kendall Jenner have been wearing with ripped jeans and perspex boots, but brightly coloured tights that look straight off the set of Gossip Girl.

This is another controversial trend we have the designer Demna Gvasalia to thank for. At Balenciaga, it was all about the colour-blocked leg for S/S 17 with models showcasing over-the-knee boots that look like lycra tights in purple, red and bright blue.
If you're brave enough, this is a look you can easily re-create with pieces you already own or just a new pair of coloured tights. Of course, if you want to do it the Balenciaga way, Net-a-Porter has a pair of logo-covered red opaques for £65. What we haven't quite worked out, however, is how the Mango model is managing to wear tights with a toe strap…
