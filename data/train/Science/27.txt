Ancient fossil 'chipped out of rock with heavy-duty tools' at Hallett Cove Conservation Park

A fossil believed to be between 500 and 870 million years old has been removed from rock with "heavy-duty tools" in "a selfish act" at South Australia's Hallett Cove Conservation Park.

The fossil, which was from a time when South Australia was under an ancient glacial lake, was reported missing in early May.

The piece was removed from a section of the geological walk that shows some exposed glacial pavement.

It would have originally been part of a lake bed and the preserved ripples from glacial activity were etched into the stone.

Mount Lofty Ranges district manager Piers Brissenden said Hallett Cove was the only location in the Southern Hemisphere where such glacial pavements existed.

"This is an internationally significant bit of geological history and it would be a shame if people negligently destroyed something which has a value to the whole world," he said.

Mr Brissenden said he believed the culprit must have climbed up the embankment and used heavy-duty tools to break off the glacial pavement.

"I would suggest someone would have to use some kind of mechanical tools to help get this off," he said.

"I think it's likely that it's some amateur collector who thinks they just like to see the merits for themselves."

He said the small fossil specimen would not have any monetary value.

"It's such a pointless thing to do ... it's just someone's selfish act," he said.

He said he was hopeful the specimen would be returned and staff would be able to restore it.

"We do work hard to educate people about the values of these sorts of conservation reserves and they are there for everyone's enjoyment," Mr Brissenden said.

"We do hope that people understand those values and they look after the parks as well."
