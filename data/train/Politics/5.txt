Joe and Jill Biden sign multi-book deal

Former vice president Joe Biden and former second lady Jill Biden have signed a multi-book deal with Flatiron Books.

Joe Biden will write two books, while Jill Biden will write one. The first book from the former vice president will examine his experiences during 2015, describing the death of his son Beau and his decision to not run for president.

"We're so deeply honored to be the publisher of these books by Vice President and Dr. Biden," Bob Miller, president and publisher of Flatiron Books, said in a statement. "The Vice President's book promises to give us all a deeper understanding of recent political history, but it will clearly also be a book about the values that have given the Vice President strength in both good times and bad."

The cost of the deal and focus of the other two books were not released. Flatiron Books is a division of Macmillan Publishers.

The deal follows a similar book deal former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama signed with Penguin Random House. The Financial Times reported the deal was for more than $60 million.
