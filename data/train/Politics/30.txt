Larissa Waters' baby makes history in Senate

Alia Joy is just weeks old but she's already made Australian political history.

The daughter of Greens co-deputy leader Larissa Waters graced the floor of the Senate on Tuesday becoming the first baby to be breastfed in the chamber.

Senator Waters returned to parliament for the first time since giving birth to her second daughter earlier this year, bringing the baby in for a feed during a vote on a Greens motion.

'So proud that my daughter Alia is the first baby to be breastfed in the federal Parliament! We need more #women parents in Parli,' she wrote on Twitter.

The milestone comes after Senator Waters instigated changes to Senate rules last year, extending rules that already allowed breastfeeding in the chamber to allow new mums and dads to briefly care for their infants on the floor of parliament.

The House of Representatives has made similar changes.

It followed another historic achievement in the Senate on Tuesday morning, with the swearing-in of new independent senator Lucy Gichuhi, the first black African member of the Australian parliament.

Greens colleague Sarah Hanson-Young made headlines back in 2009 when her two-year-old daughter Kora was taken from her arms and ejected from the Senate chamber.
