Krispy Kreme Just Launched A Line Of Ghiradelli Chocolate Doughnuts

This is the mashup that we didn't know we wanted, but now that it's here, we're stoked for it.

Krispy Kreme has teamed up with premier chocolate maker Ghiradelli to unleash two brand-new doughnuts inspired by some of Ghiradelli's most popular chocolate squares. The two new donuts, the Sea Salt Caramel Doughnut and the Mint Chocolate Doughnut, are both made with Ghiradelli ingredients.

The Sea Salt Caramel Doughnut, based on Ghiradelli's Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel Squares, are filled with Ghiradelli salted caramel and topped with Ghiradelli chocolate icing, caramel icing, amber sugar, salt sprinkles, and mini Ghiradelli chocolate chips.

The Mint Chocolate Doughnut was inspired by Ghiradelli's Mint Chocolate Squares. They are filled with a White Mint Kreme filling and topped with Ghiradelli chocolate icing, green icing, and Ghiradelli mini chocolate chips coated with powdered sugar.

Both of these donuts are available starting today at Krispy Kreme shops nationwide and are both limited-time offers.

Ghiradelli chocolates in Krispy Kreme doughnut form? That's the best of both the chocolate and doughnut worlds coming together in one singular pastry.
