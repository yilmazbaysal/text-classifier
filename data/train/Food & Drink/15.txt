London's first prosecco festival launches this weekend

Prosecco Springs, London's first (and so far only) festival dedicated to prosecco arrives this weekend at the Oval Space in East London.

The four-day event (11-14 May) aims to educate a "new generation of prosecco drinkers" by showcasing leading Italian producers via tastings and masterclasses, alongside authentic Italian cuisine and live music.


Expert sommeliers from the East London Wine School will teach visitors about the different types of prosecco, how the process from grape to glass works and how to pair prosecco with food.

Eight producers will be featured at the festival, including La Gioiosa from the Valdobbiadene region in Northern Italy. La Gioiosa is known for being floral and fruity and Victoria Moore describes the prosecco as "lively and attractive".

Other producers include Bottega, Casanova, Cester Camillo and Frozza, a winery in the hills of Colbertaldo.

The festival ticket entitles visitors to a glass of prosecco from each of the eight producers.

Visitors will also be able to enjoy authentic Italian food such as Venetian cicchetti (bar snacks and small plates), pasta e fagioli (pasta and beans), antipasti boards and more.
