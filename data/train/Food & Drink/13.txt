Manx-made and proud: the Isle of Man food you need to try

A mere 40 miles from the coast of England, it’s tempting to think of The Isle of Man as a toytown nation. A self-governing Crown Dependency of 85,000 inhabitants, it is part of the British Isles but not part of Great Britain or the United Kingdom.

Elizabeth II appears on the local £1 note (yes, they still have one) but without a crown: she is Lord of Mann not Queen here. The Manx parliament is the oldest continuous one in the world, founded by Vikings in 979AD.

These days the 35-member elected House of Keys is led by Chief Minister Howard Quayle, who is engaged in a drive to make the Isle of Man’s food reputation.

It’s not a fairytale idea. After all, Jersey is world famous for its potatoes but is a fifth of the Isle of Man’s 220 square miles. The Isle of Wight has made a name for its tomatoes and garlic.
