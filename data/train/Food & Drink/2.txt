McDonald's New Drink Will Make You Forget All About The Coffee Coolatta

Remember how confused, disappointed, and totally pissed off you were when Dunkin' Donuts announced it was removing the Coffee Coolatta from menus because it wasn't "good enough?" Well, McDonald's has a new product to fill the Coolatta-shaped hole in your heart.

With what couldn't be better timing, the Golden Arches is testing a new drink called the Minute Maid Slushie. As Brand Eating reports, the frozen treat comes in three flavors: Fruit Punch, Cherry Limeade, and Orangeade.

Unfortunately, the slushies are getting a trial run and will only available in Houston, TX, starting April 10. Hopefully, if things go well, the slushies will appear on Mickey D's menus nationwide and we'll all be able to sip on the icy goodness all summer long.
