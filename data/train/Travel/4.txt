JetBlue launching Mint service on Las Vegas and San Diego routes

JetBlue is bringing Mint, the airline's business-class cabin, to four more routes: New York-Las Vegas, New York-San Diego, Boston-San Diego and Boston-St. Maarten.
The airline operates two daily flights from New York to Las Vegas. Mint service will begin on Nov. 6 for one of the flights and Nov. 10 for the other.
JetBlue also will do staggered Mint starts for its twice-daily San Diego routes. Boston-San Diego starts Dec. 10 and Dec. 20, and New York-San Diego on Aug. 15 and Oct. 10.
Mint seats on the seasonal Saturday-only Boston-St. Maarten route will be available November through April.
In addition to the new Mint routes, JetBlue on Oct. 20 will add a fourth roundtrip Mint flight between Boston and Los Angeles.
The start date for previously announced Mint service to Seattle will be announced in the coming months.
And, Mint service between New York and Barbados will expand to include a second Saturday roundtrip, beginning Nov. 4. A second daily roundtrip is being added over the Christmas peak and on the Saturdays before and after Thanksgiving for the New York-St. Maarten route.
JetBlue is bringing back seasonal Mint service from New York to Grenada, St. Lucia and Aruba, and from Boston to Barbados and Aruba.
