Best summer job ever? Apply now if you want to serve ice-cream and DJ with your best pal

If you’re in the market for a summer job that will take you out on the road, possibly with your best pal, an English dairy firm is advertising what is says might be the ‘best summer job in the world.’ Yeo Valley in Somerset is looking for two outgoing people to take its customised camper van around to events and festivals that are happening this summer, one of whom must be an up-and-coming DJ.

The job entails playing tunes to entertain the crowds while handing out samples of Yeo Valley’s new range of organic ice cream. “They’ll be up for going on road trips in our super glittery silver ice cream van, and entertaining people with their top tunes, while sharing the Yeo Ice Cream love,” Yeo Valley says. “Pick your favourite flavour from Double Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberries & Cream and Salted Caramel, then get thinking of a set list for every occasion.”

The position will be based at Yeo Valley’s HQ in Blagdon, Somerset, which has panoramic views over the Mendip Hills. Applicants must be over 21 and hold a full driving licence, and they will be paid a £24k pro-rata salary. The perks don’t end there though, as they will also receive an ice cream allowance. The customised glam van includes a disco ball, so the successful applicants will fit right in wearing their free “sparkly disco-esque” silver uniform.

As the company is looking for a couple of people, you can even apply with your mate as long as one of you can DJ. “This might actually be the best summer job ever,” say Yeo Valley. “There will be road trips, entertaining people and lots of ice cream. We need people who can get the party started.”
