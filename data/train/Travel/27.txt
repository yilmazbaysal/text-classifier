Stargaze in the Swiss mountains – without leaving your desk
The starry night skies of Switzerland have been captured in a mesmerising new timelapse film by videographer Christian Mülhauser.

The 360-degree video entitled Helvetia By Night was created by combining more than 55,000 photographs taken by four different mirror reflex cameras between June and September of last year.

Viewers can explore the landscape from various angles by dragging the cursor across the video screen. Each featured location showcases a different mountain in Switzerland.
"Whether it be a shooting star, the miraculous Milky Way, the moonlight, the misty sea, threatening storm clouds, silent mountains or flickering lights, the surrounding space becomes a shimmering and fascinating world of wonders in the films," the videographer describes on the Helvetia By Night website.
