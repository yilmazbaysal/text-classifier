Anish Kapoor wows New Yorkers with his ‘Descension’ whirlpool installation

His ‘Bean’ sculpture in Chicago has in little more than a decade become one of the most photographed pieces of art in the world. Now sculptor Anish Kapoor is wowing New York with his latest work in a park in the shadow of the famous Brooklyn Bridge.

Descension is a pond with a difference … as the water in the middle spirals away into an endless whirling pool.
The artwork has been brought to the city by the Public Art Fund and can be visited at Pier 1 in Brooklyn Bridge Park.
It will be on view for the next four months there and visitors can see how the twenty-six-foot pool appears to disappear into infinity.

Descension was originally designed for exhibition indoors in India before later being displayed as part of an exhibition at Versailles in France.

Previously, the water in the pool was dyed black to appear like a black hole but for its Brooklyn reimagining – the water will be left untouched to mirror the East River, which is just a few yards away. Descension is part of the NYCxDESIGN festival, which will be running across New York until 24 May. Anish Kapoor has become one of the most celebrated artists of his generation from his dramatic public sculptures around the world.

He is probably best known for Cloud Gate – nicknamed the Bean – in Chicago, which has become one of the symbols in the city. Kapoor was also the brains behind the Orbit Tower, the 114 metre tall sculpture and observation tower in London.It was developed as part of the Olympic Park for the games in 2012 and has since been repurposed to feature a hair-rising 178-metre slide … which takes only 40 seconds to descend.
