Free stays in America's most beautiful state: introducing Alaska’s answer to the Scottish bothy

Scattered across Scotland – from the windswept shores of lochs to the rugged peaks of the Highlands – bothies have long provided refuge for weary hikers, who can stay in the rustic dwellings for free.

Maintained by the Mountain Bothies Association (MBA), the lodges are rudimentary affairs – most have no running water or electricity – and have long been considered unique to Scotland.

However, 4,000 miles away in Alaska exists a similar collection of huts, which, like their Scottish counterparts, provide a sanctuary to outdoor enthusiasts as they tramp around the state.

There is a small upfront fee of $20 (£16) to join the Mountaineering Club of Alaska, which helps maintain the rustic dwellings, but once on their books members can stay at the lodges free of charge.

All told there are just seven lodges in Alaska – compared to around 100 in Scotland – which can sleep up to eight people. As with Scottish bothies, the Alaskan huts cannot be booked in advance, operating instead on a first come, first served basis.

According to the Mountaineering Club of Alaska, the most popular lodge is Mint Hut, a pretty red cabin located in the foothills of the Talkeetna Mountains.

Telegraph Travel has mapped the Alaskan huts for those intending on exploring the state, which, incidentally, celebrates its 150th anniversary this year.  

The vast land had previously been owned by Russia, which sold it to the US for the bargainous sum of $7.2 million in 1867.
